The Reid and Polly Anderson Faculty Fellow. The Feig lab aims to develop low-cost, noninvasive, and widely-accessible medical technologies that integrate seamlessly with the human body. We accomplish this by developing functional materials and devices with dynamic mechanical properties, leveraging chemistry and physics insights to engineer novel systems at multiple length scales. In pursuit of our goals, we maintain a strong emphasis on integrity and diversity, while nurturing the intellectual curiosity and holistic growth of our team members as researchers, communicators, and leaders.
