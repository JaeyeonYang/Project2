Cell shape plays a critical role in regulating many physiological functions, yet little is known about how the wide variety of cell shapes are determined and maintained. Inside the cell, many proteins organize and segregate, but how they detect and respond to the cellular morphology to end up at the right place at the right time is also largely mysterious. The group uses a combination of analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to probe physical mechanisms of shape-related self-organization in protein networks, membranes, and the cell wall. Current topics of interest are (i) cell-wall biosynthesis, (ii) the regulation and mechanics of cell division, (iii) membrane organization, and (iv) membrane-mediated protein interactions. Ultimately, the manipulation of cell shape may provide a direct tool for engineering complex cellular behaviors. Education Ph. D., MIT, Physics  (2004) M.

Clark Professor in the School of Engineering and Professor of Chemical Engineering and of Bioengineering Professor Swartz received his first lessons in resourcefulness and persistence growing up on a farm in South Dakota. After earning a BS in Chemical Engineering with Highest Honors from S. Dak. School of Mines and Technology, he began his professional career with Union Oil Co. of CA in Casper, Wyoming. Serving in the Drilling, Reservoir Engineering, and Production Departments provided an appreciation of the complexity and importance of large scale energy technologies. That experience also strengthened his belief that biological technologies offered the power and versatility to better address evolving societal needs. The MIT graduate programs in chemical engineering (MS) and biochemical engineering (Dsc) helped strengthen his biological training while broadening an appreciation for this emerging field. Following a 3 month exchange visit to the Soviet Union, he gained additional experience at Eli Lilly and participated in the development of the first recombinant DNA pharmaceutical to be approved, rDNA insulin. After two years, he moved to Genentech to help establish their drug production capability, developing the fermentation process for their first product, rDNA growth hormone. After 17 years at Genentech in various line and project leadership positions, he joined the Stanford Chemical Engineering Department with a focus on an embryonic technology called cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). Multiple technology breakthroughs from his lab motivated the founding of Sutro Biopharma which now has four promising anti-cancer drugs in clinical trials. A new company called Vaxcyte later spun out of Sutro to focus on complex human vaccines enabled by CFPS. Both companies are now publicly traded. Another company, GreenLight Biosciences, is focusing on inexpensive, large scale RNA production for use against agricultural pests. At Stanford, Professor Swartz is now focusing on expanding the basic capabilities of cell-free bioprocess while also developing technologies for targeted drug development, vaccines, circulating tumor cell assays, the carbon negative production of commodity biochemicals, and for economically attractive photosynthetic hydrogen production.

The broad theme of the Barron lab is the study and biomimicry of natural host defense peptides (antimicrobial peptides). We study the molecular biophysics and mechanisms of LL-37—a centrally important human host defense peptide—and its involvement in Alzheimer's & Parkinson's diseases (via LL-37 degradation and immune system dysregulation by pathogen virulence factors). Alzheimer's dementia can be caused by (or at least, accompanied by) polymicrobial neurological and cerebral infections, a phenomenon receiving keen attention now, given recent discoveries. We are also working to develop biostable peptoid mimics of LL-37 as therapeutics that can combat antibiotic-resistant infections, especially neurological infections, ear infections, and sinus / lung infections. Finally, we work to mimic lung surfactant proteins to facilitate delivery of therapeutics to the lungs, treat bacterial and viral pneumonia, or prevent or prevent ventilator-associated lung injury. We are currently putting efforts into better understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of Covid-19, as relates to dysregulation of innate immunity; understanding why certain minority populations seem to be more strongly affected by Covid-19 infections; and developing safe therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to preventing and treating viral and we hope in the future, complex bacterial / fungal / viral co-infections, which are a likely cause of many idiopathic 'autoimmune' diseases, including cognitive impairment and loss, often in the context of poor metabolic health and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Examples include cognition in single cell protists and morphological computing in animals with no neurons and origins of complex behavior in multi-cellular systems. Broadly, we invent new tools for studying non-model organisms with significant focus on life in the ocean - addressing fundamental questions such as how do cells sense pressure or gravity? Finally, we are dedicated towards inventing and distributing “frugal science” tools to democratize access to science (previous inventions used worldwide: Foldscope, Abuzz), diagnostics of deadly diseases like malaria and convening global citizen science communities to tackle planetary scale environmental challenges such as mosquito surveillance or plankton surveillance by citizen sailors mapping the ocean in the age of Anthropocene.

He earned B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Tsinghua University and Ph.D. in Bioengineering from UC Berkeley. Before joining the Stanford faculty in 2014, Dr. Qi was a Systems Biology Faculty Fellow at UCSF. Dr. Qi is a pioneer in CRISPR technology development, particularly in the areas of epigenetic regulation and chromatin DNA imaging. He invented the first nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) system for targeted gene regulation in living cells. His lab has since expanded the CRISPR-dCas toolbox, including new tools and variants like hyperCas12a and the compact CasMINI. These new technologies have enabled CRISPRi and CRISPRa for targeted gene repression and activation in various cells and organisms, large-scale genetic perturbation screens, and precision epigenetic editing in primary cells. His lab also developed technologies for dynamic chromatin DNA imaging in live cells (LiveFISH), 3D genome structure manipulation (CRISPR-GO), and multiplexed transcriptome engineering (MEGA). Dr. Qi has used these new technologies to make key discoveries in epigenetics, such as the synergistic functions of enhancer elements in cancer gene regulation, metabolic pathways in T cell dysfunction, and novel antivirals against RNA viruses. Dr. Qi’s current research explores synthetic biology, epigenetics, immune cell engineering, and innovative targets for gene therapy in immunology and neurobiology.
