As provost, he continued his efforts to foster interdisciplinary activities in the biosciences and bioengineering and oversaw improvements in faculty and staff compensation. In October 2000, he was inaugurated as Stanford University’s 10th president, a position he held until 2016. In 2016, he cofounded the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program, which provides scholarships and leadership development for a global community of scholars enrolled in graduate programs at Stanford. The program admitted it's first class in 2018 and will provide full scholarships for up to 100 100 students every year. A pioneer in computer architecture, in 1981 Dr. Hennessy drew together researchers to focus on a computer architecture known as RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), a technology that has revolutionized the computer industry by increasing performance while reducing costs. In addition to his role in the basic research, Dr. Hennessy helped transfer this technology to industry. In 1984, he cofounded MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, which designs microprocessors. In recent years, his research has focused on the architecture of high-performance computers. Dr. Hennessy is a recipient of the 2000 IEEE John von Neumann Medal, the 2000 ASEE Benjamin Garver Lamme Award, the 2001 ACM Eckert-Mauchly Award, the 2001 Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award, a 2004 NEC C&C Prize for lifetime achievement in computer science and engineering, a 2005 Founders Award from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the 2012 IEEE Medal of Honor, IEEE's highest award. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences, and he is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He has lectured and published widely and is the co-author of two internationally used undergraduate and graduate textbooks on computer architecture design.

During this time, he built a number of early RISC microprocessors, and contributed to the design of early distributed shared memory multiprocessors. In 1990, Dr. Horowitz took leave from Stanford to help start Rambus Inc., a company designing high-bandwidth memory interface technology. After returning in 1991, his research group pioneered many innovations in high-speed link design, and many of today’s high speed link designs are designed by his former students or colleagues from Rambus. In the 2000s he started a long collaboration with Prof. Levoy on computational photography, which included work that led to the Lytro camera, whose photographs could be refocused after they were captured.. Dr. Horowitz's current research interests are quite broad and span using EE and CS analysis methods to problems in neuro and molecular biology to creating new agile design methodologies for analog and digital VLSI circuits.

Ayer Endowed Chair Professorship in the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University. He directs the Stanford Robust Systems Group, serves on the leadership team of the Microelectronics Commons AI Hardware Hub funded by the US CHIPS and Science Act, leads the Computation Focus Area of the Stanford SystemX Alliance, and is the Associate Chair (Faculty Affairs) of Computer Science. His research ranges across Robust Computing, NanoSystems, Electronic Design Automation (EDA), and Neurosciences. Results from his research group have influenced almost every contemporary electronic system and have inspired significant government and research initiatives in multiple countries. He has held several international academic appointments — the Carnot Chair of Excellence in NanoSystems at CEA-LETI in France, Invited Professor at EPFL in Switzerland, and Visiting Professor at the University of Tokyo in Japan. Prof. Mitra also has consulted for major technology companies including AMD (XIlinx), Cisco, Google, Intel, Merck (EMD Electronics), and Samsung. In the field of Robust Computing, he has created many key approaches for circuit failure prediction, on-line diagnostics, QED system validation, soft error resilience, and X-Compact test compression. Their adoption by industry is growing rapidly, in markets ranging from cloud computing to automotive systems, under various names (System Lifecycle Management, Predictive Health Monitoring, In-System Test Architecture, In-field Scan). His X-Compact approach has proven essential to cost-effective manufacturing and high-quality testing of almost all 21st century systems.

Micah Steven Siegel,https://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/micah-steven-siegel,"Main content start Visiting Professor Micah Steven Siegel Visiting Professor Micah joined the Stanford faculty as a Consulting Professor in 2006 and returned to investing full-time in 2014. His engineering research focused primarily on finding commercial applications of new software and hardware technologies, such as scientific instrumentation, molecular biology tools and AI systems. From 2006 to 2013 he also taught the graduate-level course Business for Engineers (EE204) . The EE204 course was directed to Engineering, Life Science, and Computer Science students at Stanford and covered the basic principles of business, from the engineer's perspective. Topics of EE204 included new product development, marketing, intellectual property, accounting and finance, with a focus on building profitable and well-funded technology companies based on high-profile academic research. Micah's students at Stanford have gone on to start a number of successful Silicon Valley companies such as Gusto , Notion , Visby Medical , Pulse ( acquired by LinkedIn for $90 million in 2013) and Katango ( acquired by Google in 2011). Micah was the first investor in companies that have been acquired for more than $2 billion in cash. Micah is an active investor in new technology companies formed by students, faculty, and former students at the earliest stage (often before there is a company) through his private venture capital fund, C2C Ventures , where he is the sole Managing Director. He helps founders discover attractive markets for new technologies and secure rich customers who will move fast and pay a premium for a unique solution. A market on the path to a $1B potential allows for error and time for real margins to develop. His passion is helping missionary entrepreneurs, professors and students commercialize the “Next Big Thing” in computational biology, enterprise software, scientific instruments and other technology platforms that generate complex intellectual property. A small number of companies are formed every year with foundational technologies that will change the world. Frequently these technologies were developed at universities by academic founders with limited business experience. Micah aspires to identify those companies and partner with their founders at the earliest stage to become their trusted source of capital and advice. Micah was an early VC investor in Stack Overflow (started in 2010, acquired in 2021 by Prosus for $1.8 billion in cash), Cellular Research (started at Stanford in 2013, acquired in 2015 by Becton Dickinson for $120 million in cash), Sentry (started at Disqus in 2013), BioImagene (started at UCLA in 2003, acquired in 2010 by Roche for $100 million in cash), Judicata (started at Stanford in 2012, acquired in 2020 by FastCase), Hadapt (started at Yale in 2011, acquired in 2014 by Teradata), and C2C Patents (started at Stanford in 2014). Earlier he was an investor in Affinity Engines (started at Stanford in 2002, litigation resulted in a license and settlement with Google in 2006), and Adapt Technologies (started at Caltech in 2004, acquired in 2008 by Webvisible, now a subsidiary of Vivial ). These companies have raised more than $70 million in seed-stage venture capital and $525 million in follow-on capital from Accel Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Bezos Expeditions, Founders Fund, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Union Square Ventures, and other leading venture capital firms. He began his career in 1993 working directly for Carver Mead to design early artificial intelligence (AI) systems in VLSI. In 1999, he and Craig Johnson , a well-known Silicon Valley lawyer, formed C2C Ventures. Micah is a techie and the co-inventor of several U.S. patents related to genetic engineering and software systems, and was recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Intellectual Asset Management Magazine as one of the world's 250 ""Leading IP Experts"" (""IAM 250""), and in 2003 by MIT Technology Review magazine, as ""one of the top 100 innovators of the world"" ("" TR100 List "").
