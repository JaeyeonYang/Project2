Redox-active materials promise the efficient transformation between electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, and are at the heart of carbon-neutral energy cycles. Understanding design rules that govern materials chemistry and architecture holds the key towards rationally optimizing technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and novel thermodynamic cycles. Electrochemical and chemical reactions involved in these technologies span diverse length and time scales, ranging from Ångströms to meters and from picoseconds to years. As such, establishing a unified, predictive framework has been a major challenge. The central question unifying our research is: “can we understand and engineer redox reactions at the levels of electrons, ions, molecules, particles and devices using a bottom-up approach?” Our approach integrates novel synthesis, fabrication, characterization, modeling and analytics to understand molecular pathways and interfacial structure, and to bridge fundamentals to energy storage and conversion technologies by establishing new design rules.

We think about how to rationally design engineered interfaces to enhance communication with biological cells and tissues, or to improve energy conversion and materials synthesis. In particular, we are interested in seamlessly integrating inorganic structures together with biology for improved cell transfection and therapies, and designing new materials, often using diamondoid molecules as building blocks. My group is very interested in how to design new inorganic structures that will seamless integrate with biological systems to address problems that are not feasible by other means. This involves both fundamental work such as to deeply understand how lipid membranes interact with inorganic surfaces, electrokinetic phenomena in biologically relevant solutions, and applying this knowledge into new device designs. Examples of this include “nanostraw” drug delivery platforms for direct delivery or extraction of material through the cell wall using a biomimetic gap-junction made using nanoscale semiconductor processing techniques. We also engineer materials and structures for neural interfaces and electronics pertinent to highly parallel data acquisition and recording. For instance, we have created inorganic electrodes that mimic the hydrophobic banding of natural transmembrane proteins, allowing them to ‘fuse’ into the cell wall, providing a tight electrical junction for solid-state patch clamping. In addition to significant efforts at engineering surfaces at the molecular level, we also work on ‘bridge’ projects that span between engineering and biological/clinical needs. My long history with nano- and microfabrication techniques and their interactions with biological constructs provide the skills necessary to fabricate and analyze new bio-electronic systems.

Andrew J. Mannix,https://mse.stanford.edu/people/andrew-mannix,"Main content start Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Andrew J. Mannix Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Atoms set the ultimate limit for materials engineering. Andy Mannix’s research focuses on tailoring materials at this atomic scale to control their electronic properties, driving advances in electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum technologies. His group specializes in the growth, fabrication, and characterization, of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals interfaces with the goal of building platforms for deterministic atomic-scale engineering. To advance this frontier, the Mannix lab develops growth techniques to produce 2D semiconductor films with minimal defects and precisely tuned doping. These materials are integrated into nanoscale devices to optimize interfaces and evaluate performance. Leveraging machine learning and AI, the lab accelerates material quality assessments and pioneers robotic assembly methods for van der Waals heterostructures in high/ultra-high vacuum environments. The group’s expertise in scanning probe microscopy, including scanning tunneling and advanced atomic force microscopy, enables exploration of material structure and properties with atomic precision. Andy joined Stanford University’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) in 2020. He has received the Office of Naval Research YIP Award (2024) and the NSF CAREER Award (2024). He earned his B.S. in MSE from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and his Ph.D. in MSE from Northwestern University, where, as an NSF GRFP Fellow, he pioneered the growth and atomic-scale characterization of new 2D materials, including borophene. During his Kadanoff-Rice Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Chicago, he developed innovative methods for robotic heterostructure assembly and processing of 2D materials.

He has been an assistant professor in the Materials department at UC Santa Barbara (2016-2020), held postdoctoral appointments at IBM TJ Watson Research Center (2016) and MIT (2015), and worked as a transceiver engineer at Finisar (2009-2010). The Mukherjee group specializes in semiconductors that emit and detect light in the infrared. Our research enables better materials for data transmission, sensing, manufacturing, and environmental monitoring. We make high-quality thin films with IV-VI (PbSnSe) and III-V (GaAs-InAs/GaSb) material systems and spend much of our time understanding how imperfections in the crystalline structure such as dislocations and point defects impact their electronic and optical properties. This holds the key to directly integrating these semiconductors with silicon and germanium substrates for new hybrid circuits that combine infrared photonics and conventional electronics.
