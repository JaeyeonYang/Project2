We have recently introduced a new unifying paradigm, SPLASH (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing), a data-compressive signal extraction that bypasses the historical computational machinery of genomics. Ongoing work extends the scope of this approach, making many problems in genomic sequence analysis easily accessible to computational engineers and statisticians. We are using SPLASH and its sister algorithms to train biological deep learning models at unprecedented scale, and leveraging these models to predict phenotypes and from single cell analyses of human and non-model organisms to drug responses in microbes, and other phenotypes across the tree of life, including in the study of plants, viruses, oceanic systems and their symbioses. The reference-free nature of SPLASH and its sister approaches enable dually the prediction of biological behavior – eg phenotype and attribution of the features responsible for these predictions.

Biondo Biondi,https://icme.stanford.edu/people/biondo-biondi,"Main content start Barney and Estelle Morris Professor Biondo Biondi Barney and Estelle Morris Professor My students and I devise new algorithms to improve the imaging of active and passive seismic data. Images obtained from seismic data are the primary source of information on the structural and stratigraphic complexities in Earth's subsurface and on many subsurface dynamic processes. These images are constructed by processing seismic wavefields recorded at the Earth's surface and generated by either active-source (e.g., vibroseis trucks) experiments or by natural (e.g., ocean waves) and anthropogenic (e.g., vehicle traffic) sources. Because our datasets are enormous, and wavefield propagation needs to be accurately modeled to achieve high-resolution imaging, we need to harness the power of the latest computational hardware to test our methods on field data. Therefore, mapping imaging algorithms into high-performance architecture is an essential component of our research. The amount and quality of information that we can extract from seismic data are directly linked to the temporal and spatial sampling of the sources and the receivers. In the past several years, we have been working on methods to process data recorded by using fiber cables as seismic sensors. Fiber-optic seismic recording promises to enable cost-effective continuous seismic monitoring at a large scale. A particularly exciting possibility is leveraging preexisting telecommunication infrastructure to record seismic data with dense arrays in urban environments continuously. In 2016 we pioneered that idea by recording data under the Stanford campus. Since then, we recorded data in San Jose and on a 48-km array under Stanford and neighboring cities.

Ching-Yao Lai,https://icme.stanford.edu/people/ching-yao-lai,"Main content start Assistant Professor of Geophysics Ching-Yao Lai Assistant Professor of Geophysics My group attacks fundamental questions in ice-dynamics, geophysics, and fluid dynamics by integrating mathematical and machine-learned models with observational data. We use our findings to address challenges facing the world, such as advancing our scientific knowledge of ice dynamics under climate change. The length scale of the systems we are interested in varies broadly from a few microns to thousands of kilometers, because the governing physical principles are often universal across a range of length and time scales. We use mathematical models, simulations, and machine learning to study the complex interactions between fluids and elasticity and their interfacial dynamics, such as multiphase flows, flows in deformable structures, and cracks. We extend our findings to tackle emerging topics in climate science and geophysics, such as understand the missing physics that governs the flow of ice sheets in a warming climate. We welcome collaborations across disciplinary lines, from geophysics, engineering, physics, applied math to computer science, since we believe combining expertise and methodologies across fields is crucial for new discoveries.

We approach this challenge by developing customized mathematical models that can be tested against observational data and are informed by community needs through a scientific co-production process. We intentionally work on extremes across different natural systems rather than focusing on one specific natural system to identify both commonalities in the physical processes driving extremes and in the best practices for mitigating risk at the community level. Our current research priorities include volcanic eruptions, ice-sheet instability, permafrost disintegration, induced seismicity and flood-risk mitigation.
