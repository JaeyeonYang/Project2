Introduction:

The research laboratory of Professor C. Forbes Dewey, Jr., PhD, has made significant contributions to the field of biological engineering, particularly in understanding the biomechanical interactions between blood flow and the endothelial cells lining arterial walls.  Their primary focus is on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease leading to the buildup of plaque within arteries, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.  Professor Dewey’s group has pioneered investigations into the intricate relationship between fluid shear stress, the mechanical force exerted by blood flow on endothelial cells, and cellular responses that either protect against or promote atherosclerosis development.

A cornerstone of Professor Dewey’s research is the detailed characterization of endothelial cell mechanotransduction.  Endothelial cells are remarkably sensitive to the forces of blood flow.  His lab was the first to demonstrate the precise time course with which endothelial cells reorganize and reorient themselves in response to the direction of fluid shear stress. This pioneering work, using advanced microscopy techniques, revealed the dynamic nature of endothelial cell behavior under physiological flow conditions.  This discovery fundamentally altered our understanding of how blood flow influences endothelial cell function and morphology.  Further research delved into the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this reorientation, identifying specific signaling pathways and cytoskeletal rearrangements involved in the cellular response to shear stress.

The lab's methodological approach is multidisciplinary, integrating techniques from biological engineering, cell biology, and biomechanics.  In vitro models utilizing microfluidic devices, which allow precise control over flow parameters, have been central to their investigations.  These models mimic the in vivo environment, enabling researchers to study endothelial cell responses to various flow patterns and magnitudes.  Advanced microscopy techniques, such as confocal microscopy and time-lapse imaging, are employed to visualize and quantify cellular responses, including cell shape changes, cytoskeletal reorganization, and focal adhesion dynamics.  The integration of molecular biology techniques allows for the analysis of gene expression changes and protein interactions in response to mechanical stimuli.

Professor Dewey’s research transcends the simple observation of endothelial cell reorientation.  It delves into the broader implications of this response for the prevention or progression of atherosclerosis.  The endothelium acts as a critical interface between blood and the underlying arterial wall. Under normal, physiological flow conditions, the aligned endothelial cells generate anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory signals, contributing to vascular homeostasis.  Conversely, disturbed or low shear stress, often encountered in areas of arterial branching or plaque formation, disrupts this protective effect. This disruption can lead to endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased permeability, inflammation, and an enhanced susceptibility to leukocyte adhesion and lipid accumulation, all key events in the atherosclerotic process.

The research conducted by Professor Dewey’s lab has significantly advanced our understanding of the complex interplay between fluid mechanics and cellular biology in the context of vascular health.  Their findings have direct implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis.  For instance, understanding the molecular mechanisms of endothelial cell mechanotransduction can inform the design of targeted therapies to restore endothelial function in areas of disturbed flow, thereby preventing plaque formation and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Their work also lays the foundation for advancements in tissue engineering, potentially enabling the development of bioengineered vascular grafts that better withstand the mechanical forces of blood flow and minimize the risk of thrombosis and restenosis.  In summary, the contributions of Professor Dewey’s laboratory represent a significant advancement in the field of biological engineering, bridging the gap between biomechanics and cellular processes with far-reaching implications for cardiovascular health.
