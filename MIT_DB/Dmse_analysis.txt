In the context of environmental sustainability, they explore the use of self-assembled nanomaterials for applications such as water purification, remediation of pollutants, and the development of sustainable catalysts.  For example, they may design materials capable of selectively adsorbing heavy metals from contaminated water or creating self-assembled catalytic structures for efficient degradation of organic pollutants.

In the area of human health, the research group focuses on the development of biocompatible and biodegradable nanomaterials for drug delivery, biosensing, and tissue engineering. This involves the synthesis of molecules that can encapsulate therapeutic agents, selectively target diseased cells, and trigger controlled release of drugs.  Their self-assembled nanostructures could also serve as scaffolds for tissue regeneration, providing a biocompatible environment for cell growth and tissue repair.  The biocompatibility of these materials is rigorously assessed using various in vitro and in vivo assays.

The research group led by Professor Christopher Schuh, formerly at MIT and now Dean of the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University, focuses on the fundamental understanding and innovative design of structural materials, primarily metals and ceramics.  Their research approach is highly interdisciplinary, effectively integrating experimental methods, analytical theory, and computational simulations to unravel the intricate relationships between material processing, microstructure, and resulting properties.  This holistic approach allows for a deep understanding of material behavior, enabling the design and development of advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

A core theme of their research is the design of novel materials at the atomic level.  This involves manipulating the microstructure, such as engineering grain boundaries in metals or optimizing the lattice structure in ceramics, to achieve desirable properties. This  "bottom-up" design approach is exemplified by their work on shape-memory ceramics.  They have successfully created a new category of shape-memory materials from ceramics, overcoming limitations in existing systems by designing materials that can operate at higher temperatures with minimal damage. This achievement relies on multimode modeling, a sophisticated computational technique enabling the prediction and optimization of material behavior at various length scales. The development of low-hysteresis shape-memory ceramics significantly expands the potential applications of shape-memory materials in demanding high-temperature environments.

This underscores their commitment to translating fundamental scientific discoveries into practical technological advancements.  Furthermore, their work extends to the development of novel metallic coatings, as demonstrated by their contribution to the commercial success of Xtalic, a company that utilizes a Schuh Group process for producing coatings now integral in electrical connectors globally.

Materials characterization forms an integral part of their research workflow.  Through advanced techniques, they meticulously analyze the microstructure and properties of their materials, validating experimental observations and refining theoretical models.  This iterative process enables continuous improvement in material design and processing, leading to optimized performance in targeted applications.  The group's research also directly addresses challenges associated with scaling up laboratory-scale discoveries for industrial production. The explicit emphasis on technology transfer highlights their commitment to not only generating fundamental knowledge but also to translating it into practical, real-world solutions.

The overall contribution of Professor Schuh’s research group to Materials Science and Engineering is substantial.

Introduction:

Professor Krystyn Van Vliet's research group at Cornell University, formerly at MIT, focuses on the fascinating intersection of materials science, chemistry, biology, and mechanics—a field known as chemomechanics. Their primary research objective is understanding and manipulating material behavior at the interface between different phases, particularly those that are thermodynamically metastable. These metastable states often exhibit complex behaviors due to the coupling between chemical reactions and mechanical stresses, making them challenging to analyze experimentally and computationally.  The group's approach is deeply interdisciplinary, combining advanced experimental techniques with computational modeling to unravel these complex interactions.

A significant portion of their research centers around cell-material interactions.  The group investigates how the mechanical properties of materials, specifically their stiffness, influence cell adhesion, drug uptake, and cellular differentiation.  This is crucial for designing biomaterials with tailored properties for biomedical applications, such as controlled drug delivery systems and tissue engineering scaffolds.  The lack of comprehensive understanding of these interactions, stemming from both the biological complexity and limitations in experimental/computational tools, represents a key challenge the group directly addresses.  Their work aims to bridge this gap by developing novel experimental methods to quantitatively characterize the effects of material properties on biological processes.

The group's methodology involves a synergistic combination of experimental and computational approaches.  They employ techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other surface-sensitive characterization methods to probe material properties at the nanoscale and to study the dynamics of ligand-receptor interactions at the cell surface. These techniques allow for detailed measurements of material stiffness and its influence on binding kinetics. In parallel, computational modeling, likely involving molecular dynamics simulations, helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms and predicting material behavior under various conditions.  This integrated approach allows for a much more complete picture of the complex interactions than relying on either experimental or computational methods alone.

A key contribution of Professor Van Vliet’s group has been the development and application of novel experimental strategies for rapidly mapping environment-structure-property relations in engineered materials.  This involves tailoring material properties, such as surface chemistry and mechanical stiffness, and subsequently evaluating the impact on desired functionalities.  This work often involves the synthesis and processing of novel nanocomposites, combining organic and inorganic components to achieve desired material properties. This high-throughput experimentation combined with advanced characterization techniques, allows for the rapid identification of promising material candidates with optimized properties. The group’s insights into the interplay between material properties and biological responses at the interface hold significant promise for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and other biomedical fields.

Furthermore, their focus on thermodynamically metastable interfaces pushes the boundaries of our understanding of material behavior in challenging conditions.  This fundamental research contributes significantly to the broader field of materials science by developing new theoretical frameworks and experimental methodologies.  By drawing parallels between simpler non-biological interfaces and complex cell-material interactions, the group provides a valuable framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems. The work undertaken within this research group is therefore critical for both fundamental scientific advancement and for the translation of this knowledge into real-world applications with significant societal impact.
