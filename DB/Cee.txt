They also investigate the behavior of **granular flows**, focusing on how the collective motion of discrete particles leads to macroscopic properties like density, stress, and flow patterns. This research has implications for various areas, including the design of efficient transportation systems, understanding natural hazards like landslides, and designing improved industrial processes. The study of **multiphase flows**, which involve the interaction of multiple fluid phases (e.g., water and air), forms another important component of their research.  Understanding the dynamics of these flows is critical in tackling environmental challenges such as water pollution, sediment transport, and coastal erosion.

To complement their experimental efforts, the lab employs advanced theoretical and computational modeling techniques. This includes developing and applying **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** models to simulate complex flow behaviors that may be difficult or impossible to study experimentally.  Moreover, they utilize **agent-based modeling** techniques to simulate the behavior of systems composed of interacting individuals, providing insights into the mechanisms driving self-organization and pattern formation. Their research leverages principles from **nonlinear dynamics**, **stochastic processes**, and **network science** to better understand the intricate interplay of factors that shape environmental complexity.

The lab's contributions to the field are significant and diverse. Their findings have advanced our understanding of fundamental fluid mechanics, providing new insights into turbulence, mixing, and pattern formation.  Their work in granular flows has improved our ability to predict and mitigate the risks associated with natural hazards and industrial processes.  Furthermore, their research on collective behavior and self-organization has implications for numerous fields, ranging from ecology and biology to social sciences and materials science.  By combining experimental rigour with theoretical sophistication, the Environmental Complexity Lab at Stanford continues to make valuable contributions to the scientific community and to the development of solutions for complex environmental challenges.
