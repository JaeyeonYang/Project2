This research is highly relevant to numerous industrial applications and fundamental scientific questions.

The group’s research tackles the fundamental challenge of elucidating the intricate relationship between a complex fluid's microstructure – the arrangement and interaction of its constituent particles – and its macroscopic properties, such as viscosity, rheology, and diffusion.  Understanding this relationship is crucial for designing and controlling the behavior of these materials in various applications.  Examples of the complex fluids studied include suspensions (solid particles in a liquid), colloidal dispersions (nanometer-sized particles in a liquid), liquid crystals (materials with ordered molecular arrangements), ferrofluids (magnetic fluids), electrorheological fluids (fluids whose viscosity changes under an applied electric field), and polymer solutions and melts (long-chain molecules in solution or a molten state).

A cornerstone of the Brady Group's methodology is their development and application of a novel computational technique known as Stokesian Dynamics. This sophisticated numerical method enables the group to perform detailed simulations, effectively conducting "numerical experiments," to quantitatively predict the structure-properties relationships of complex fluids under a variety of processing conditions.

The group's expertise lies in developing and applying novel theoretical and computational techniques, particularly in the realm of tensor networks, to address these challenges.

A core strength of the Chan Group is their integration of first-principles electronic structure calculations with sophisticated many-body techniques.  They utilize highly accurate methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and potentially post-Hartree-Fock methods, to obtain fundamental parameters, like exchange interactions, crucial for describing the behavior of the systems they study. These parameters then feed into their highly developed many-body modeling techniques, enabling them to address systems far beyond the reach of direct quantum chemical calculations.

A key methodological innovation showcased in their recent work is the application of hyperoptimized tensor network contractions.  This technique, developed specifically to tackle the computational complexities of simulating quantum supremacy circuits, has been successfully adapted to solve the challenging problem of calculating the exact partition function for large spin systems. This allows for the precise prediction of thermodynamic properties like magnetization and heat capacity, quantities directly accessible through experiments.

Their recent publication on the giant {Mn84} torus single-molecule magnet exemplifies this approach. This molecule, with its 84 Mn(II) ions, presents a formidable challenge to theoretical modeling due to its high nuclearity and intricate interplay of electronic and magnetic interactions.  By utilizing first-principles calculations to determine the relevant exchange interactions, and then employing hyperoptimized tensor network contractions to evaluate the exact partition function of the resulting classical spin Hamiltonian (Potts and Ising models), they are able to directly compute the experimentally observable magnetization and heat capacity.  The comparison between the theoretically calculated and experimentally measured data demonstrates a remarkable qualitative agreement, highlighting the accuracy and power of their combined computational and experimental approach.

Furthermore, their research reveals limitations of current theoretical models in dealing with large magnets.  The sensitivity of the results to small, long-range exchange couplings underscores the necessity for continued refinement of both theoretical models and computational techniques. This crucial finding contributes not only to a deeper understanding of magnetic materials but also provides valuable guidance for future research directions in this complex area.

The Flagan Research Group at Caltech is a leading research group dedicated to advancing the understanding of aerosols, their formation, evolution, and impact on climate, human health, and various environmental processes.  Their research spans a broad spectrum, encompassing laboratory studies, field campaigns, and the development of novel aerosol measurement techniques.  A central theme uniting their diverse projects is the meticulous measurement and analysis of particle size distributions, ranging from molecular clusters to supermicron particles, which underpins their ability to probe fundamental aerosol processes.

One major focus of the Flagan group's research is the atmospheric aerosol and its role in climate change.  Aerosols, suspensions of particles in a gas, significantly influence the Earth's radiative budget.  While greenhouse gases exert a warming effect, aerosols can exhibit both cooling (through scattering of sunlight) and warming (through absorption of solar radiation) effects, making their overall impact complex and challenging to quantify.  The Flagan group contributes to reducing this uncertainty by characterizing the global distribution of aerosols, and particularly focusing on secondary organic aerosols (SOA), a major component of atmospheric aerosols formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  Their laboratory and field studies, including participation in the CLOUD experiment at CERN, employ sophisticated instruments to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of SOA formation, growth, and their impacts on cloud formation. The CLOUD experiment, with its exceptionally clean atmospheric chamber, allows the group to probe the processes of new particle formation at an unprecedented level of detail, following the transition of clusters to larger particles molecule-by-molecule.  This allows for a fundamental understanding of the processes responsible for almost half of the global cloud condensation nuclei.

Another crucial research area is the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on human health. Epidemiological studies show a strong correlation between PM2.5 levels and various adverse health effects.  However, PM2.5 is a broad measure, and the Flagan group seeks to gain a more nuanced understanding by studying the effects of nanoparticles, particularly those emitted from sources like heavy-duty diesel traffic. This requires the development and application of advanced measurement tools capable of resolving particle size distributions in the low nanometer regime, thereby pinpointing the specific types and sizes of particles contributing to health risks.  This work extends to the emerging field of nanotechnology, where the group investigates potential inhalation risks associated with engineered nanomaterials.

A significant contribution of the Flagan Research Group lies in the development of state-of-the-art aerosol measurement methods.  They have a long history of innovation, having developed the widely used scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which allows for rapid and accurate measurement of particle size distributions.  Their recent development of the nano-radial differential mobility analyzer (nRDMA) and the radial opposed migration ion/aerosol analyzer (ROMIAC) extends the capabilities of SMPS, enabling high-resolution measurements down to 1 nm and molecular separations, respectively.  The ROMIAC represents a fundamental advance in particle sizing, offering improved resolution and enabling miniaturization of the instrument, opening possibilities for cost-effective and portable sensors.  These advanced measurement techniques are crucial for both laboratory and field studies, supplying data that improve atmospheric models and provide crucial information for policy decisions.

Further contributing to the understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, the group conducts extensive field campaigns using the CIRPAS Twin Otter research aircraft.  This allows for in-situ measurements of aerosols and clouds in diverse environments globally, providing valuable data for validating remote sensing observations and improving atmospheric models.  These comprehensive measurements, coupled with detailed laboratory studies, represent a holistic approach to unraveling the complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and climate. The work also extends to the impact of larger particles, such as pollen allergens, on human health, where advanced computer-vision-based techniques are employed for automated pollen identification and counting. In summary, the Flagan Research Group's contributions are multifaceted, encompassing fundamental research, technological innovation, and practical applications in addressing critical environmental and health challenges.
