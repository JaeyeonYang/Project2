A central theme uniting their diverse projects is the meticulous measurement and analysis of particle size distributions, ranging from molecular clusters to supermicron particles, which underpins their ability to probe fundamental aerosol processes.

One major focus of the Flagan group's research is the atmospheric aerosol and its role in climate change.  Aerosols, suspensions of particles in a gas, significantly influence the Earth's radiative budget.  While greenhouse gases exert a warming effect, aerosols can exhibit both cooling (through scattering of sunlight) and warming (through absorption of solar radiation) effects, making their overall impact complex and challenging to quantify.  The Flagan group contributes to reducing this uncertainty by characterizing the global distribution of aerosols, and particularly focusing on secondary organic aerosols (SOA), a major component of atmospheric aerosols formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  Their laboratory and field studies, including participation in the CLOUD experiment at CERN, employ sophisticated instruments to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of SOA formation, growth, and their impacts on cloud formation. The CLOUD experiment, with its exceptionally clean atmospheric chamber, allows the group to probe the processes of new particle formation at an unprecedented level of detail, following the transition of clusters to larger particles molecule-by-molecule.  This allows for a fundamental understanding of the processes responsible for almost half of the global cloud condensation nuclei.

Another crucial research area is the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on human health. Epidemiological studies show a strong correlation between PM2.5 levels and various adverse health effects.  However, PM2.5 is a broad measure, and the Flagan group seeks to gain a more nuanced understanding by studying the effects of nanoparticles, particularly those emitted from sources like heavy-duty diesel traffic. This requires the development and application of advanced measurement tools capable of resolving particle size distributions in the low nanometer regime, thereby pinpointing the specific types and sizes of particles contributing to health risks.  This work extends to the emerging field of nanotechnology, where the group investigates potential inhalation risks associated with engineered nanomaterials.

A significant contribution of the Flagan Research Group lies in the development of state-of-the-art aerosol measurement methods.  They have a long history of innovation, having developed the widely used scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which allows for rapid and accurate measurement of particle size distributions.  Their recent development of the nano-radial differential mobility analyzer (nRDMA) and the radial opposed migration ion/aerosol analyzer (ROMIAC) extends the capabilities of SMPS, enabling high-resolution measurements down to 1 nm and molecular separations, respectively.  The ROMIAC represents a fundamental advance in particle sizing, offering improved resolution and enabling miniaturization of the instrument, opening possibilities for cost-effective and portable sensors.  These advanced measurement techniques are crucial for both laboratory and field studies, supplying data that improve atmospheric models and provide crucial information for policy decisions.

Further contributing to the understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, the group conducts extensive field campaigns using the CIRPAS Twin Otter research aircraft.  This allows for in-situ measurements of aerosols and clouds in diverse environments globally, providing valuable data for validating remote sensing observations and improving atmospheric models.  These comprehensive measurements, coupled with detailed laboratory studies, represent a holistic approach to unraveling the complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and climate. The work also extends to the impact of larger particles, such as pollen allergens, on human health, where advanced computer-vision-based techniques are employed for automated pollen identification and counting. In summary, the Flagan Research Group's contributions are multifaceted, encompassing fundamental research, technological innovation, and practical applications in addressing critical environmental and health challenges.
