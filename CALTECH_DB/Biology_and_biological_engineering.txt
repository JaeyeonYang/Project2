Introduction:
The Zinn lab, located within the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, focuses on elucidating the roles of cell surface proteins in neural development and function, with a particular emphasis on synaptic connectivity. The lab's research leverages both *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit fly) and human model systems to identify and characterize protein interactions that govern these processes. Their work has significantly contributed to our understanding of how specific protein interactions direct neuronal wiring, cell survival, and ultimately, behavior.

A central theme of the Zinn lab's research is the mapping of protein-protein interactions using high-throughput screening methods. Initially, their work focused on the *Drosophila* nervous system, culminating in a global extracellular interactome screen published in 2013, in collaboration with the Garcia group at Stanford. This screen identified over 80 novel interactions among 200 fly cell surface proteins, laying the foundation for subsequent investigations into the functional roles of these interactions. Recognizing the importance of translating these findings to human biology, the Zinn lab expanded their interactome screening efforts to human cell surface proteins, again in collaboration with the Garcia group. A key accomplishment was a screen of over 500 human immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) cell surface proteins, published in 2020.

To overcome the limitations of traditional ELISA-based interactome screens, the lab developed innovative methodologies. Recognizing that a comprehensive screen of all ~2000 human single-transmembrane cell surface proteins would require the assessment of approximately 5 million pairwise interactions, they developed BPIA, a bead-based technology that allows for the simultaneous analysis of a single "prey" protein binding to hundreds of "bait" proteins attached to different fluorescently coded beads. Further innovations involved assembling prey proteins into 60-mer nanoparticles and utilizing the same extracellular domain (ECD) fusion proteins as both baits and preys, enhancing the speed, sensitivity, and versatility of the assay. These technological advancements formed the basis of a Transformative Research Grant (TRO1) from the NIH, awarded in 2022. This grant fuels the ongoing global human interactome screen, a collaborative effort involving the Zinn lab, the Protein Expression Center (headed by Jost Vielmetter), and the Thomson group at Caltech, and is directed by Woj Wojtowicz.

Beyond identifying protein interactions, the Zinn lab is dedicated to understanding their functional consequences. A significant focus is on the Dpr-ome and Beat-Side interaction networks in *Drosophila*. These networks consist of interacting IgSF proteins, such as Dprs, DIPs, Beats, and Sides, which are expressed in subsets of neurons during development. The lab's research has demonstrated that DIP::Dpr interactions play critical roles in controlling synaptic connectivity and cell survival in the optic lobe and neuromuscular system. Their work has shown, for example, that interactions between Dpr11 and DIP-g control cell survival and synapse formation in specific optic lobe circuits. Studies on Dpr6, Dpr10, and DIP-a interactions have revealed the importance of binding affinity in regulating cell survival and neuronal targeting.

Furthermore, the Zinn lab explores the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in RNA transport between cells in *Drosophila*. They have identified a cell surface protein, Stranded at Second, which mediates the targeted delivery of EVs containing a virus-like particle called dArc1. Their previous work on Drosophila receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) demonstrated their involvement in axon guidance and synapse formation.

Collectively, the Zinn lab's research provides fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms governing neural development and synaptic connectivity. Their innovative methodologies, comprehensive interactome screens, and detailed functional studies have significantly advanced the field and offer promising avenues for understanding and potentially treating neurological disorders.

A significant focus of the lab is on Fourier Ptychographic microscopy, a technique that fundamentally transforms the approach to high-throughput digital pathology. This method cleverly redefines the problem of achieving high-resolution imaging, casting it as a computational challenge rather than a purely optical one. By meticulously capturing a series of low-resolution images under varying illumination angles, Fourier Ptychography utilizes sophisticated computational algorithms to reconstruct a high-resolution complex image of the sample. This approach effectively surpasses the physical constraints imposed by conventional microscope lenses, enabling the visualization of intricate cellular structures and features with unprecedented clarity. The computational nature of the technique also opens up possibilities for post-processing and analysis, such as quantitative phase imaging and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, the lab is actively exploring the implementation of compact parallel microscopy solutions based on Fourier Ptychography.

This innovative technique tackles the inherent limitations posed by the turbidity of biological tissues, which severely restricts the penetration depth and resolution of conventional optical imaging methods. The lab's work in this area leverages the principle of optical time-reversal to correct for the scattering and aberrations introduced by the tissue. By precisely measuring the distorted wavefront of light that has propagated through the tissue, they can generate a time-reversed wavefront that, when re-emitted, focuses sharply at the desired target location within the tissue. This capability holds immense potential for various applications, including incisionless laser surgery, where focused laser energy can be precisely delivered to target tissues without damaging surrounding areas. Additionally, time-reversal optical focusing promises to enable high-resolution and deep-penetrating biochemical tissue imaging, providing valuable insights into the molecular processes occurring within biological systems. The technique also has implications for optogenetics, allowing for the precise activation of light-sensitive proteins deep within tissues, which could revolutionize neurological research and therapies.

In summary, the Biophotonics Laboratory is dedicated to developing and applying advanced optical and microfluidic technologies to address critical challenges in biology and medicine.

Introduction: The Voorhees Lab focuses on understanding the intricate processes that govern protein production and quality control within the cell. Moving beyond the basic understanding of genetic information translation into amino acid sequences, the lab delves into the subsequent, and equally crucial, steps required for a protein to become functional. Their research acknowledges that the synthesis of a polypeptide chain is merely the beginning of a complex journey involving proper folding, accurate localization within the cell, and the formation of necessary complexes with other proteins. These steps are not isolated events but are meticulously monitored by cellular quality control pathways, which identify and eliminate defective mRNAs and proteins, ensuring proteome fidelity.

The lab's research is driven by two fundamental questions: first, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis and assembly; and second, deciphering how cells recognize and degrade aberrant mRNAs and proteins that fail during the maturation process. Understanding these pathways is critical, as defects in these downstream biosynthetic and surveillance mechanisms are implicated in a wide range of human diseases. By focusing on the intricate interplay between protein synthesis machinery and quality control factors, the Voorhees Lab aims to provide insights into the molecular basis of proteome maintenance and disease prevention.

The Voorhees Lab employs a multifaceted approach to address these complex biological questions. Their methodology is rooted in a combination of structural and functional techniques, allowing them to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular players and their interactions. A key technique they utilize is in vitro reconstitution, which allows for the precise control of experimental conditions and the study of individual components in isolation. This approach enables the researchers to dissect complex pathways and identify the specific roles of each factor involved.

Complementing in vitro reconstitution are biochemical and cell-based assays, which provide valuable insights into the dynamics and regulation of these processes within a cellular context. These assays allow researchers to study the effects of mutations and other perturbations on protein synthesis, folding, and degradation, providing a more complete picture of the cellular response to stress and disease.

A particularly powerful tool employed by the Voorhees Lab is cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This technique allows for the visualization of macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolution, providing critical structural information about the protein synthesis machinery, quality control factors, and their interactions. By combining structural data with functional assays, the Voorhees Lab is able to build detailed models of these complex processes, revealing the molecular mechanisms that underlie proteome fidelity.

The contributions of the Voorhees Lab are significant to the broader field of molecular biology and have implications for understanding and treating a variety of human diseases. By unraveling the molecular mechanisms of protein biosynthesis, assembly, and quality control, their research provides a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these essential cellular processes. Specifically, a deeper understanding of these processes may lead to the development of therapies that enhance protein folding, improve cellular localization, or promote the degradation of misfolded proteins, ultimately contributing to the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by proteome dysfunction. Their commitment to both structural and functional analysis, leveraging advanced techniques like cryo-EM, places them at the forefront of research into protein homeostasis and its impact on human health.

Introduction: The Alexander J. Varshavsky research lab has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the ubiquitin system and its role in regulated protein degradation. Their research spans a broad range of topics, from the fundamental mechanisms of protein turnover to its implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and sleep regulation. The lab's work is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, combining biochemical, genetic, and cell biological techniques to unravel complex biological processes.

A central focus of the Varshavsky lab is the ubiquitin system, particularly the N-degron pathway. The lab has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms of N-degron recognition, identifying the key enzymes involved (E3 ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitylating enzymes), and characterizing the physiological substrates of this pathway. Their discovery that the N-terminal residue of a protein can serve as a degradation signal (the N-end rule) revolutionized the understanding of protein half-life regulation. They demonstrated that specific N-terminal residues, termed "destabilizing residues," target proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The lab has identified and characterized numerous components of the N-degron pathway, including the UBR family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, arginyltransferases, and N-terminal amidases. Their work has revealed the diverse functions of the N-degron pathway in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromosome stability, cardiovascular development, and neurogenesis. Furthermore, the lab has pioneered methods for studying the N-degron pathway, such as the heat-inducible degron and split-ubiquitin assays, which have been widely adopted by the scientific community.

In addition to their work on the ubiquitin system, the Varshavsky lab is exploring the potential of targeting cancer cells based on DNA deletions. This innovative approach leverages the fact that cancer cells often accumulate homozygous DNA deletions that are absent in normal cells. The lab proposes that these deletions can serve as "immutable signposts" for selective cancer therapy, enabling the development of drugs that specifically target and eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal tissues.

Another area of research in the Varshavsky lab concerns the molecular basis of sleep. The lab has proposed the "fragment generation (FG) hypothesis," which posits that sleep evolved, at least in part, to counteract the accumulation of protein fragments in the brain and other organs during wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, the production of protein fragments, even at low levels, can disrupt cellular function and impair cognition, leading to the need for sleep to clear these fragments and restore normal brain activity. The lab's current research focuses on testing this hypothesis and identifying the specific protein fragments that contribute to sleep regulation.

The Varshavsky lab has also made significant contributions to the development of new biochemical and genetic methods. These include techniques for mapping DNA replication intermediates, mapping nucleosomes, ubiquitin fusion techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and methods for detecting protein interactions and protein degradation. These methods have proven to be invaluable tools for studying a wide range of cellular processes. The Varshavsky lab's work has had a profound impact on the fields of protein degradation, ubiquitin biology, cancer therapy, and sleep research. Their discoveries have provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms of cellular regulation and have opened new avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The lab's central mission is to decipher the intricate mechanisms that govern cell fate determination and to leverage this understanding for both fundamental discovery and translational applications, including the synthesis of novel cell types.

A core component of the lab's research lies in the development and application of mathematical models to dissect the complex cellular regulatory networks that orchestrate the vast diversity of cell types found within the human body. These models serve as a framework for formulating testable hypotheses about how specific gene regulatory circuits respond to intrinsic and extrinsic cues, driving cells down particular differentiation pathways. By exploring the parameter space of these models, the lab aims to identify key control points that can be manipulated to precisely engineer cellular physiology.

Beyond purely theoretical approaches, the Thomson Lab utilizes a powerful combination of experimental methodologies, including high-throughput gene expression analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq, in particular, is leveraged to capture comprehensive snapshots of gene expression patterns within individual cells, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and dynamics during differentiation. The lab has also developed novel computational tools to infer cell state trajectories from scRNA-seq data, allowing them to reconstruct the developmental pathways that cells traverse as they differentiate. These computational tools contribute significantly to the field by offering robust and efficient methods for analyzing increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.

A significant area of investigation involves the application of these models and experimental techniques to engineer and rewire cellular physiology. In one recent accomplishment, the lab developed an all-optical differentiation system. This system enables the precise delivery of pulsed neural differentiation inputs to embryonic stem cells via light, providing unprecedented temporal control over the differentiation process. This optogenetic approach allows researchers to probe the sensitivity of cells to differentiation signals and to uncover the critical windows of opportunity for directing cell fate. Such an approach exemplifies the lab's commitment to creating innovative tools and methods for manipulating cellular behavior.

Another notable achievement is the development of a stochastic modeling framework for analyzing the principles that govern the robust self-organization of complex tissues, such as the mammary gland. This framework allows the lab to investigate how cell-cell communication, mechanical forces, and other factors contribute to the emergent properties of tissues, providing a deeper understanding of tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Understanding these principles is crucial for both developing tissue engineering strategies and understanding disease processes, such as cancer.

Furthermore, the lab is actively exploring the synthesis of new types of cells that do not exist in nature.

Introduction: The Sternberg Lab investigates the systems biology of nematodes, particularly focusing on how an organism's properties, encompassing development, physiology, and behavior, are encoded within its genome. The lab's primary model organism is the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* (C. elegans), leveraging its powerful molecular genetics for in-depth studies. However, their research scope extends beyond *C. elegans* to include parasitic nematodes, most notably *Steinernema hermaphroditum*, as well as other model systems such as budding yeast, mice, jellyfish, fungi, and human cells, when necessary. This broad approach reflects the lab's commitment to understanding fundamental biological principles applicable across diverse species.

A core strategy employed by the Sternberg Lab is to perturb the activity of specific genes and meticulously observe the resulting cellular or organismal misbehavior. This allows them to infer gene function and delineate genetic pathways. Gene expression is quantified through RNA-seq and transgenic reporters, while behavioral analyses are conducted using automated systems and optogenetics. A central theme of their research centers on intercellular signals and their subsequent transduction within responding cells, ultimately leading to transcriptional outputs. By dissecting these signaling cascades, the lab aims to uncover the intricate regulatory networks that govern development and behavior.

A significant aspect of the Sternberg Lab's work lies in identifying nematode genes that are counterparts to human genes. Recognizing the challenges in studying human gene function directly, the lab effectively utilizes the molecular genetics of *C. elegans* to investigate human genes with limited actionable information, particularly those implicated in human diseases. They study the consequences of genetic variants found in human individuals, including those associated with autism spectrum disorder, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex conditions.

Given the significance of nematodes as health and agricultural pests, the lab also prioritizes research into parasite-relevant biology. This includes investigating dauer/infective juvenile development, a crucial survival strategy for parasitic nematodes, using genomic and molecular genetic approaches. The lab’s recent publications highlight their diverse areas of expertise. They've made advancements in understanding enrichment analysis techniques, showing how focusing on steps in pathways, rather than genes alone, enhances the inference of differentially expressed pathways. Significant progress has also been made in cloning genes in *Steinernema hermaphroditum*, leading to the molecular identification of a peroxidase gene that controls body size in this insect-killing nematode, and in developing cGAL drivers for use in *C. elegans* sensory neurons.

Their work also extends to understanding how *C. elegans* processes chemosensory cues at different life stages, particularly in the context of CO2 and dauer formation. They've investigated the mechanical properties influencing mating behavior in *C. elegans* and characterized the transcriptomic profiles of sex-specific olfactory neurons. Furthermore, the lab is actively involved in developing and applying cutting-edge technologies, including hyperspectral imaging and solid medium-based culturing methods for *Steinernema hermaphroditum*. The Sternberg Lab is also deeply invested in knowledge modeling of neural circuits in *C. elegans*, mapping the adult worm at single-nucleus resolution, and advancing data standards to ensure FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in genomics research. Through these diverse and interconnected research avenues, the Sternberg Lab makes significant contributions to our understanding of nematode biology, with implications for both human health and agriculture.

This integrated approach allows for the investigation of regulatory logic at multiple scales, from the molecular interactions of transcription factors to the emergent properties of cell populations during development.

The Stathopoulos Lab's research significantly contributes to the broader field of developmental biology by elucidating the principles that govern cell fate determination and tissue morphogenesis. Understanding how cells acquire their identities and how this acquisition influences their roles within the developing organism is crucial for comprehending the fundamental processes of life. Furthermore, the insights gained from these studies have implications for understanding developmental disorders and regenerative medicine. By meticulously dissecting the regulatory landscape of development in *Drosophila*, the lab is uncovering conserved principles of gene regulation that are relevant across a wide range of species, including humans.

Specifically, the lab's work focuses on understanding how combinations of transcription factors interact with DNA at cis-regulatory modules to control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. This involves identifying the specific DNA sequences that bind transcription factors, characterizing the protein-protein interactions between transcription factors, and determining how these interactions influence the activity of the associated genes. A key challenge lies in deciphering the combinatorial code that determines the specificity of gene expression, i.e., how different combinations of transcription factors can lead to different outcomes.

Another important area of investigation is the temporal coordination of CRMs. Many genes are regulated by multiple CRMs, which may be located on non-contiguous stretches of DNA. The lab is exploring how these CRMs coordinate their activities over time to ensure that genes are expressed at the correct stage of development. This involves studying the dynamics of transcription factor binding, the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors, and the role of chromatin modifications in regulating gene expression.

The lab utilizes a combination of genetic approaches, such as generating mutant alleles of transcription factors and CRMs, biochemical approaches, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA affinity purification, and live *in vivo* imaging techniques to visualize the dynamics of gene expression in real-time. These techniques, coupled with sophisticated quantitative analysis methods, enable the lab to gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory networks that control development.

This allows them to observe the intricate dynamics of neural networks during the acquisition, performance, and consolidation of memory tasks. By recording activity during different brain states, including sleep periods preceding and following experience, they can analyze the structure of cortico-hippocampal interactions under varying conditions.

The lab’s research efforts are directed at characterizing how the structure of cortico-hippocampal interactions is modulated by behavior and how it evolves throughout the learning process. They seek to understand how this structure reflects the intrinsic organization of memory processing at the level of neuronal networks. In other words, they aim to decode the network-level code that underlies memory formation and recall.

Beyond multi-electrode recordings, the lab also integrates two-photon imaging and whole-cell recordings to gain a deeper understanding of the contributions of different neuronal cell types to circuit dynamics. This multi-faceted approach allows them to probe the activity of specific cell types within the network and understand their roles in the overall process of memory formation and consolidation.

The lab employs a multidisciplinary approach combining in vitro developmental biology, high-resolution characterization of individual cell developmental states, and the molecular genetics of gene regulation. A central focus is the identification of key transcription factors and signaling pathways that induce the expression of T-lineage specific genes in uncommitted precursor cells. Furthermore, they are interested in elucidating how these factors and pathways function to suppress alternative developmental fates, thereby ensuring commitment to the T-cell lineage.

To dissect this complex process, the Rothenberg lab utilizes in vitro differentiation systems and retroviral perturbation techniques. These methods enable a kinetic analysis of T-cell development, allowing for the determination of the specific roles of individual regulatory molecules in successive, highly defined developmental contexts. This approach has proven particularly insightful in revealing the powerful influence of transcription factor-transcription factor interactions in stem cell-based developmental systems more broadly.

Introduction: The Orphan Lab, led by Victoria, conducts multidisciplinary research at the intersection of environmental microbiology, geochemistry, and geology. The lab’s primary focus is characterizing the intricate relationships between microorganisms and their environment, specifically within the context of biogeochemical cycles. By integrating cutting-edge methodologies, the group investigates the ecological roles and physiological adaptations of archaea, bacteria, and viruses involved in the cycling of key elements such as methane, sulfur, nitrogen, and various metals. Their work is particularly relevant to understanding these processes in ocean sediments and extreme environments, offering insights into the functioning of these often-overlooked ecosystems.

A cornerstone of the Orphan Lab's approach is the application of environmental ‘omics. This encompasses techniques such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, which allow for a comprehensive analysis of the genetic potential, gene expression, and protein activity within complex microbial communities. By sequencing the total DNA from environmental samples (metagenomics), the lab can identify the diversity of microorganisms present and infer their potential metabolic capabilities. Metatranscriptomics, on the other hand, reveals which genes are actively being expressed, providing a snapshot of the community's current metabolic activities. Finally, metaproteomics allows for the identification and quantification of proteins, directly linking gene expression to functional processes within the environment. The integration of these ‘omics approaches provides a holistic understanding of the microbial communities under investigation.

Complementing the ‘omics analyses, the lab utilizes stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive forms of elements that vary slightly in mass. Microorganisms preferentially utilize certain isotopes during metabolic reactions, leading to distinct isotopic signatures in their biomass and metabolic products. By measuring these isotopic signatures, the lab can trace the flow of elements through the microbial food web and identify the key players involved in specific biogeochemical processes. For example, by analyzing the carbon isotopic composition of methane, the lab can determine whether it is produced biogenically by archaea or derived from abiotic sources.

Furthermore, the Orphan Lab employs advanced imaging techniques to visualize microorganisms and their interactions within their natural environment. These techniques, which may include confocal microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and electron microscopy, provide valuable insights into the spatial organization of microbial communities and the physical interactions between different species. Imaging techniques can also be used to track the uptake of substrates by individual cells or to visualize the formation of biofilms and other microbial structures. By combining imaging with ‘omics and stable isotope analysis, the lab gains a comprehensive understanding of the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of the studied environments.

The Orphan Lab’s research contributes significantly to our understanding of microbial processes in ocean sediments and extreme environments. These environments are often characterized by unique geochemical conditions and harbor specialized microbial communities that play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles. By elucidating the metabolic pathways and ecological interactions of these microorganisms, the lab is providing valuable information for predicting the response of these ecosystems to environmental change. For instance, understanding the factors controlling methane cycling in ocean sediments is crucial for predicting the release of this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Similarly, understanding the microbial processes that drive metal cycling in extreme environments can inform the development of bioremediation strategies for contaminated sites.

Introduction: The Oka Lab is dedicated to unraveling the intricate mechanisms by which the brain and body collaborate to maintain internal biological balance. Their research focuses on understanding how the central nervous system, peripheral chemosensory systems, and gut-brain communication pathways interact to regulate essential physiological processes, particularly those related to appetite, satiation, and the balance of water and sodium. Utilizing rodent models, the lab aims to identify the specific central and peripheral signals involved in internal state regulation, determine the circumstances under which these signals are triggered, and elucidate how they contribute to observable behavioral outputs.

A core theme of the lab's research is the relationship between appetite, satiation, and reward, especially in the context of nutrient ingestion. The Oka Lab investigates how the brain governs the initiation and termination of ingestive behaviors, a critical aspect of maintaining health given the risks associated with both over- and under-consumption. Their work explores the real-time monitoring of internal needs and ingestive actions by the brain. Significant findings, as evidenced by their publications in *Nature* and *Neuron*, have shown how rapid satiation signals, triggered by liquid gulping and changes in gut osmolality, are transmitted to the brain to suppress thirst even before water absorption. This research highlights the sophisticated neural mechanisms underlying the fine-tuned regulation of fluid intake.

The lab also investigates the neural basis of water and sodium balance, essential for body fluid homeostasis and overall survival. Imbalances in these nutrients can lead to serious health complications, making the understanding of their regulation a crucial area of study. The Oka Lab has made significant contributions to this field by identifying specific neural circuits that govern water intake in the forebrain lamina terminalis (published in *Nature*) and sodium ingestion in a hindbrain structure (also published in *Nature*). Building upon these discoveries, the lab's current research focuses on understanding how individual appetites are processed across different brain regions and how the circuits responsible for sodium appetite and thirst interact to maintain internal osmolality. This research promises to reveal the integrated neural architecture that supports fluid and electrolyte balance.

Furthermore, the Oka Lab explores how the valence of sensory inputs, such as taste, changes depending on an organism's internal state. Eating and drinking are more enjoyable when one is hungry or thirsty, reflecting a state-dependent modulation of sensory perception. The lab investigates the peripheral and central mechanisms that underlie this valence regulation. Their research, as highlighted by publications in *Nature* and *Nature Neuroscience*, has demonstrated that the hedonic value of sodium taste increases when the body is sodium-depleted, driven by the activation of appetite neurons in the brain. Similarly, the valence of oral water detection signals shifts depending on the dehydration status. The Oka Lab seeks to dissect the neural circuitry and underlying logic that drive these internal-state-dependent changes in the valence of sensory inputs like water and sodium signals. This work offers fundamental insights into how internal states shape sensory perception and guide behavior. Overall, the Oka Lab’s research is characterized by a multi-faceted approach combining neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques to understand the neural basis of internal state regulation and its influence on motivated behaviors. Their contributions provide critical insights into the brain’s role in maintaining homeostasis and adapting to changing internal and external environments.

These models are essential for deciphering the neural code and understanding how visual information is represented within the brain.

Beyond simply observing neural activity, the Meister lab is also deeply interested in understanding how these computations are performed at the cellular and circuit level. This requires gaining access to the internal components of the neuronal circuits, a task they accomplish using both fine electrodes for intracellular recording and molecular tools to manipulate neuronal function. The ultimate objective is to develop a comprehensive neural circuit diagram that effectively simulates the operation of the visual system. Such a diagram would not only represent the connectivity of neurons but also capture the dynamic interactions and computations that occur within the circuit.

A key aspect of the lab's work involves exploring the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the design of these visual circuits. Given the high degree of conservation in the early visual system across species, from mice to humans, the lab hypothesizes that these circuits serve a common purpose. For example, they investigate whether the structure of the retina and optic nerve is optimized for efficient information transmission or for rapid extraction of survival-critical signals. To test these hypotheses, the researchers employ circuit modification techniques, altering the structure or function of specific circuits and then monitoring the resulting effects on visual behavior. By perturbing the system and observing the consequences, they can gain insights into the underlying functional roles of specific circuit elements. This approach bridges the gap between neural circuit architecture and its behavioral consequences.

Introduction: The Mazmanian Lab investigates the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, with a particular focus on neurological disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). Their research explores the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis and how alterations in the gut microbiota can influence neurodevelopment, behavior, and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The lab employs a multidisciplinary approach, combining microbiology, immunology, neuroscience, and animal behavior studies to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying these interactions.

A primary focus of the Mazmanian Lab is understanding the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, diseases characterized by the aggregation of the protein α-synuclein (αSyn). Specifically, their work on Parkinson's Disease, a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor dysfunction, has revealed a critical link between gut bacteria and disease progression. Using mouse models that overexpress αSyn, they have demonstrated that the presence of a gut microbiota is essential for the development of motor deficits, microglia activation (a hallmark of neuroinflammation), and αSyn pathology in the brain. This groundbreaking finding suggests that PD, at least in the tested animal models, is not solely a consequence of events within the brain, but rather involves a complex interplay between the gut and the brain.

The lab's research further indicates that this gut-brain communication is not merely correlative, but causal. Through antibiotic treatment to deplete the gut microbiota, they observed an amelioration of PD-like symptoms in mice. Conversely, colonization of germ-free mice, lacking any gut microbiota, with bacteria promoted pathophysiology, highlighting the crucial role of postnatal gut-brain signaling in disease development. Significantly, they identified short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbial metabolites produced during the fermentation of dietary fiber, as key mediators of this communication. Oral administration of SCFAs to germ-free mice induced neuroinflammation and exacerbated motor symptoms, providing a mechanistic link between specific microbial products and neurological dysfunction.

Adding further clinical relevance to their findings, the Mazmanian Lab demonstrated that transferring microbiota from PD patients to αSyn-overexpressing mice resulted in enhanced physical impairments compared to mice receiving microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. This observation underscores the potential of the human microbiome as a novel risk factor for PD and opens up exciting avenues for developing microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

Beyond Parkinson's Disease, the lab's broader interests encompass the influence of the gut microbiome on a variety of neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, as indicated by Dr. Mazmanian's TEDMED talk.

Introduction: The research lab focuses on unraveling the intricate interplay between chromatin structure and RNA in the dynamic regulation of gene expression. Their central research question revolves around understanding how chromatin architecture influences the fate of RNA transcripts and, conversely, how RNA transcripts can direct alterations in chromatin organization. This bidirectional relationship forms the core of their investigation into transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory processes. The lab aims to provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on the roles of small non-coding RNAs in inducing chromatin modifications and influencing transcriptional activity within animal systems. Furthermore, they are interested in defining the role of chromatin in influencing post-transcriptional gene regulatory events.

At the heart of their research lies the ambition to decipher the complex molecular mechanisms governing gene expression. Their work is driven by the fundamental understanding that gene expression is not simply a linear process of DNA to RNA to protein but rather a highly regulated and dynamic system influenced by a multitude of factors. Chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that packages the genome, plays a crucial role in determining the accessibility of genes to the transcriptional machinery. By investigating how chromatin structure dictates the fate of RNA transcripts, the lab seeks to illuminate the epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression patterns. This includes understanding how specific chromatin modifications, such as histone acetylation and methylation, affect the initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription.

Complementary to this investigation is the exploration of how RNA molecules, particularly small non-coding RNAs, can influence chromatin structure and transcription. Small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and piRNAs, are known to play critical roles in gene regulation by targeting mRNA molecules for degradation or translational repression. However, their ability to also modulate chromatin and transcription adds another layer of complexity to gene regulatory networks. The lab's research aims to uncover the specific mechanisms by which these small RNAs interact with chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors to alter gene expression. This includes identifying the specific RNA sequences and protein partners involved in these interactions, as well as characterizing the downstream effects on gene expression profiles.

To achieve these goals, the research lab adopts an interdisciplinary approach, integrating a diverse range of experimental and computational techniques. Biochemistry is employed to study the interactions between chromatin, RNA, and regulatory proteins at the molecular level. Genetic approaches are used to identify and characterize the genes involved in these regulatory processes. Cell and molecular biology techniques are utilized to investigate the functional consequences of chromatin and RNA modifications in cellular contexts. Computational biology and functional genomics are leveraged to analyze large-scale datasets generated from transcriptomic and epigenetic studies, providing a system-wide view of gene regulation. This integrated approach allows the lab to address their research questions from multiple angles, providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the interplay between chromatin and RNA in gene expression control.

The lab's contributions to the field lie in their ability to dissect the complex mechanisms underlying gene regulation. By focusing on the bidirectional relationship between chromatin and RNA, they are providing valuable insights into the dynamic and adaptable nature of gene expression. Their work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of development, disease, and evolution, as gene regulation is fundamental to all biological processes. The mechanistic insights gained from their research could also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by dysregulation of gene expression, such as cancer and developmental disorders.

Introduction: The William G. Dunphy laboratory focuses on understanding the intricate mechanisms by which cells accurately duplicate themselves, with a particular emphasis on cell cycle checkpoints and the preservation of genomic integrity. Their research investigates the molecular pathways that ensure faithful DNA replication and segregation during cell division, crucial processes for maintaining genomic stability and preventing diseases like cancer. The lab utilizes both human tissue culture cells and Xenopus egg extracts as model systems to explore these fundamental biological questions.

Initially, the lab's research centered on the enzymatic network governing the entry of cells into mitosis. They investigated Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF), a master regulatory kinase responsible for triggering mitotic entry through the phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins. Their work elucidated the composition of MPF, identifying its key components as a cyclin, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1, formerly known as Cdc2), and the ancillary Cks protein. The lab's early contributions significantly advanced the understanding of how MPF orchestrates the hallmark events of mitosis, including chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope disassembly, and mitotic spindle assembly.

Recognizing the importance of accurate DNA replication and DNA integrity for proper cell division, the Dunphy lab shifted its focus to cell cycle checkpoints. These checkpoints act as surveillance mechanisms, ensuring that DNA replication is complete and that the genome is free of damage before the cell proceeds into mitosis. The lab investigates the sensor and effector proteins involved in these checkpoint pathways, as well as the mediator proteins that facilitate communication between them. Specifically, they study how these pathways can influence the transcriptional program of the cell, stabilize stalled replication forks, and even trigger apoptosis in cases of severe DNA damage.

A significant portion of the lab's recent work has been dedicated to understanding the molecular pathways leading to the activation of ATR, a master regulatory kinase activated in cells with incompletely replicated DNA. They have also investigated the downstream targets of ATR and their roles in checkpoint responses. Notable contributions include the identification of TopBP1 as a specific activator of ATR and Claspin as a mediator protein that enables ATR to recognize and phosphorylate Chk1, a key effector kinase in the checkpoint pathway.

Further research led to the discovery of Treslin, a novel replication protein that physically interacts with TopBP1. Through detailed characterization, the lab demonstrated that Treslin, along with its binding partner MTBP, is essential for activating the replicative helicase at replication origins across the genome. Currently, the lab is employing molecular and genome-wide approaches, including the CUT&RUN method to map the genome-wide distribution of Treslin-MTBP on chromatin in human cells, to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which the Treslin-MTBP complex initiates DNA replication. These studies aim to determine how cells choose specific locations to begin replicating their DNA.

The overarching goal of the Dunphy lab's research is to understand how cells maintain the integrity of their genomes. This research is highly relevant to human health, as cancer cells often exhibit a breakdown in the mechanisms that maintain genomic stability. By unraveling the molecular details of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA replication, the Dunphy lab is providing crucial insights into the fundamental processes that prevent genomic instability and contribute to the development of cancer therapeutics.

Introduction: The research lab focuses on elucidating the intricate mechanisms that govern mitochondrial dynamics and their implications in health and disease. Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, are highly dynamic organelles whose function is regulated by a complex interplay of processes, including fusion, fission, degradation (mitophagy), and interactions with other cellular compartments. The lab's core research area revolves around understanding these fundamental processes and how they contribute to overall mitochondrial function.

A primary focus is the study of mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics. These opposing processes, constantly shaping the mitochondrial network, are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health and adapting to cellular stress. Fusion allows for the exchange of mitochondrial contents, compensating for damaged components, while fission enables the segregation of dysfunctional mitochondria for subsequent removal via mitophagy. The lab investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying these dynamic events, identifying key proteins and regulatory pathways involved. They are particularly interested in understanding how disruptions in fusion and fission contribute to various pathologies.

Beyond fusion and fission, the lab also delves into the mechanisms of mitochondrial degradation, primarily mitophagy. Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy that targets damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation via lysosomes. This process is essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality control and preventing the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). The researchers are actively exploring the signaling pathways that trigger mitophagy and the specific proteins involved in the selective targeting of mitochondria for degradation. Understanding the regulation of mitophagy is critical for developing therapeutic strategies to combat diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

The lab also investigates the interactions of mitochondria with other organelles, recognizing that mitochondria do not function in isolation but rather as integral components of a complex cellular network. These interactions, including physical contacts and signaling pathways, are vital for coordinating cellular processes such as calcium signaling, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. The researchers are mapping the intricate communication networks between mitochondria and other organelles, with a particular focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peroxisomes. Deciphering these interactions provides valuable insights into the broader cellular context of mitochondrial function and dysfunction.

The lab’s research extends to exploring the role of mitochondrial dynamics in a wide range of physiological processes, including cellular development and differentiation.

Introduction: The Judith L. Campbell laboratory investigates the fundamental mechanisms and regulation of DNA replication and repair, with a particular focus on how these processes contribute to genomic stability and influence cancer development. Their research is driven by the observation that genomic instability, characterized by chromosome aberrations and DNA damage, is a hallmark of cancer cells. Understanding the molecular pathways that prevent such instability is crucial for developing effective cancer therapies.

The lab employs a multi-faceted approach, integrating yeast genetics, biochemistry, Xenopus egg extracts, and human cell models to dissect the intricacies of DNA replication and repair. A central theme of their work is the study of DNA2, a helicase identified by Martin Budd within the lab as the first eukaryotic helicase essential for DNA replication. Their research suggests that DNA2 is an “Achilles heel” for cancer cells, making it a prime target for developing small molecule inhibitors to sensitize tumors to chemotherapeutic agents. The lab's focus on DNA2 stems from its critical role in Okazaki fragment processing during lagging-strand DNA replication, a process they have extensively characterized through enzymatic studies. These studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of the replisome, demonstrating that it's not a fixed machine but a complex assembly of proteins that constantly exchange partners to ensure accurate DNA synthesis. Current research focuses on understanding how reversible acetylation and phosphorylation regulate these protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

Beyond its role in replication, the lab has also elucidated the involvement of DNA2 in DNA repair pathways, particularly in double-strand break (DSB) repair. They have shown that DNA2 works in conjunction with the yeast BLM ortholog, Sgs1, in the major pathway of DSB repair, a process conserved in both yeast and human cells. This collaboration is crucial for the initial resection of the 5' terminated strand of the DSB, leading to the formation of a single-stranded 3' end. This step is critical because it determines whether the cell will utilize the accurate homologous recombination pathway or the more error-prone non-homologous end-joining pathway. Furthermore, the single-stranded DNA intermediate plays a vital role in activating the cell cycle checkpoint, which protects the cell from genome instability in the presence of DSBs resulting from replication fork failure.

The lab's research also extends to the study of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. They have found that DNA2 localizes to telomeres and participates in the resection of DNA at these structures, a process important for maintaining telomere stability and preventing chromosome degradation. They are actively investigating whether similar mechanisms are conserved in human cells.

In summary, the Campbell lab has made significant contributions to our understanding of DNA replication, repair, and genomic stability. Their work on DNA2 has revealed its critical role in both replication and repair pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer. By combining genetic, biochemical, and cell-based approaches, they continue to unravel the complex mechanisms that govern DNA maintenance and explore their implications for human health and disease, particularly in the context of cancer and premature aging.

Introduction:
The Bronner Laboratory investigates the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the development and evolution of neural crest cells and ectodermal placodes, two crucial cell populations in vertebrate embryogenesis. Employing a powerful multiorganismal approach, the lab compares developmental processes across a range of vertebrate species, from the basal lamprey to zebrafish, frog, chick, and mouse. This comparative strategy allows the researchers to identify both conserved and divergent mechanisms that orchestrate the formation and differentiation of these cell types.

The neural crest is a transient, migratory cell population that originates at the border between the neural plate and the developing epidermis. Following their delamination from the neuroepithelium in a rostrocaudal wave, neural crest cells embark on extensive migrations throughout the developing embryo, ultimately giving rise to a remarkably diverse array of cell types. These derivatives include much of the head skeleton, epidermal pigment cells (melanocytes), and, in conjunction with cranial placodes, the peripheral nervous system. The laboratory's focus on the neural crest stems from its unique role in vertebrate development and its involvement in numerous congenital disorders and cancers.

The Bronner lab aims to elucidate the gene regulatory networks that control neural crest development. They explore the complex interactions between transcription factors, signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifiers that govern cell fate decisions, migration patterns, and differentiation processes. By dissecting these regulatory mechanisms, the researchers gain a deeper understanding of how neural crest cells acquire their specific identities and contribute to the formation of various tissues and organs.

The lab's comparative approach is particularly insightful, as it allows them to track evolutionary changes in neural crest development. By comparing the molecular mechanisms underlying neural crest formation across different vertebrate species, they can identify conserved regulatory modules that are essential for neural crest development, as well as divergent mechanisms that contribute to the diversity of neural crest derivatives in different lineages. This evolutionary perspective sheds light on the origins of vertebrate-specific features and provides a framework for understanding how developmental processes have been modified over time.

Given the involvement of neural crest-derived cells in a range of birth defects, such as craniofacial abnormalities and heart defects, and cancers, including neurofibromatosis, melanoma, and neuroblastoma, the Bronner lab's research has significant implications for human health.

Introduction: The David Anderson Lab focuses on unraveling the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotion. The central aim is to understand how fundamental properties that characterize emotional states, such as their persistence, scalability, and valence (positive or negative quality), are encoded within the brain's circuitry and neurochemistry. The lab investigates how these internally generated states interact with incoming sensory information to generate specific emotional behaviors, with a particular emphasis on fear and aggression. Their research seeks to identify the specific neural circuits and molecular mechanisms that causally control these internal emotional states and subsequent behavioral outputs.

A key feature of the Anderson Lab's approach is the utilization of a diverse and powerful set of cutting-edge techniques. They employ optogenetics and chemogenetics to precisely manipulate the activity of genetically defined populations of neurons, allowing them to establish causal relationships between specific neural circuits and emotional behaviors. These techniques involve using light (optogenetics) or chemical compounds (chemogenetics) to activate or inhibit specific neurons, providing a high degree of spatiotemporal control. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is used to characterize the molecular identity and function of individual neurons within these circuits, providing a comprehensive understanding of their gene expression profiles. Furthermore, viral tracing techniques are employed to map the connections between different brain regions involved in emotional processing, allowing the researchers to delineate the anatomical pathways underlying specific emotional behaviors. These manipulation and mapping experiments are complemented by electrophysiological recordings and functional imaging techniques to measure neural activity in real-time, providing a dynamic picture of how neural circuits function during emotional states.

The lab has historically utilized both mice and the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* as model organisms. These models provide complementary advantages. Mice, with their more complex brain structures and behavioral repertoire, allow for the investigation of higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. *Drosophila*, on the other hand, offer genetic tractability and relatively simple nervous systems, making them ideal for dissecting the fundamental neural circuits underlying basic emotional behaviors.

In a more recent and innovative direction, the Anderson Lab has established *Clytia hemisphaerica*, a genetically tractable jellyfish, as a novel model system. This represents a significant departure from traditional vertebrate and invertebrate models. The goal of this research is to investigate whether these ancient organisms, which lack a centralized brain structure, exhibit purely reflexive behaviors or possess some form of primitive internal state representation. By studying the neural and behavioral mechanisms in these simple organisms, the lab hopes to gain insights into the evolutionary origins of emotion and the fundamental principles of neural circuit function. This comparative approach, spanning diverse species, allows the lab to identify conserved neural mechanisms that are critical for emotional processing across the animal kingdom, shedding light on the fundamental building blocks of emotion and behavior. The lab's multi-faceted approach positions them at the forefront of research aiming to understand the complex interplay of neural circuits, genetics, and behavior in the context of emotion.

Introduction: The Andersen Lab is a leading research group dedicated to understanding the neural mechanisms underlying intention, motor planning, and sensory-motor integration, with a particular focus on the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Led by Richard A. Andersen, the lab leverages a multidisciplinary approach combining neurophysiological recordings, neuroimaging techniques, and computational modeling to unravel the complexities of brain function and develop innovative brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Their research aims to bridge the gap between basic neuroscience and clinical applications, particularly for individuals with paralysis.

A core focus of the Andersen Lab is the investigation of the PPC's role as a crucial link between sensation and action. Their work has demonstrated the existence of an anatomical map within the PPC dedicated to planning different types of movements, including eye movements and arm movements. They have shown that these action plans are represented in a cognitive format, specifying the goals of intended movements rather than specific muscle commands. This understanding of the PPC's function in intention formation forms the foundation for their BMI development.

The lab employs a range of methodologies to study brain function. Neurophysiological recordings, particularly using chronically implanted intracortical microelectrodes, are central to their research. These electrodes allow for the long-term monitoring of neural activity in both animal models and human participants. Their recent publications detail the quantification of physical degradation and performance of these microelectrodes over extended periods, highlighting the challenges and advancements in chronic implantation techniques. Furthermore, the lab utilizes advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional ultrasound neuroimaging to visualize brain activity at a mesoscopic scale, revealing the organization of saccades in the lateral intraparietal area of the PPC. These complementary approaches provide a comprehensive view of neural processes.

The Andersen Lab has made significant contributions to the field of BMIs. Their research has successfully translated findings from animal studies to the development of BMIs for tetraplegic human participants, enabling them to regain motor control through thought. They have demonstrated the feasibility of using intention signals recorded from the PPC to control external devices. A recent publication highlights the use of neural networks to enhance BMI control by extracting relevant features from neural data. Another breakthrough is the development of a BMI device that predicts internal speech in a second patient, showcasing the potential for restoring communication abilities in individuals with paralysis. The lab actively engages in clinical trials, documenting the experiences of participants with brain implants, as evidenced by the interview with a clinical trial subject, James Johnson.

Furthermore, the lab explores the neural encoding of sensory information within the PPC. They investigate how observed and actual somatosensations are represented in this brain region, providing insights into the neural basis of perception and body awareness. They also examine the stability of neural subspaces representing imagined movements in the parietal cortex over several years, revealing the long-term consistency of motor representations. The lab's ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of brain function and the development of neurotechnologies to improve the lives of individuals with neurological disorders. Their commitment to both fundamental research and translational applications positions them as a leading force in the field of neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces.

Introduction: The John M. Allman lab focuses on elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. This research aims to understand the pathogenesis of these debilitating conditions by investigating the cellular and molecular changes that occur in the aging brain and in individuals affected by dementia. The lab's core hypothesis centers on the idea that a reduced capacity to maintain healthy axons is a critical factor contributing to the development and progression of these neurodegenerative diseases.

To explore this hypothesis, the Allman lab employs a multi-faceted approach, leveraging cutting-edge techniques in molecular biology, neuroimaging, and cellular biology. A key aspect of their research is the use of RNA-Seq, a powerful tool for analyzing the transcriptome, the complete set of RNA transcripts in a cell or tissue. By comparing RNA profiles from normal elderly individuals with those of patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the lab aims to identify gene expression changes that are associated with the disease process. These changes may reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention or provide insights into the molecular pathways that are disrupted in neurodegeneration.

In addition to RNA-Seq, the Allman lab utilizes Seq-FISH, a sophisticated technique that combines sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Seq-FISH allows for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple RNA transcripts within individual cells, providing a high-resolution view of gene expression patterns. This approach is particularly valuable for studying the complex cellular heterogeneity of the brain and for identifying specific cell types that are vulnerable to neurodegeneration.

Immunocytochemistry, another essential technique employed by the lab, enables the visualization and localization of proteins within cells and tissues. By using antibodies that specifically bind to target proteins, researchers can assess the levels and distribution of these proteins in different brain regions and cell types. This information can be used to identify changes in protein expression or localization that are associated with neurodegeneration, such as the accumulation of misfolded proteins or the loss of synaptic markers.

The Allman lab also collaborates with Dr. Ryan Cabeen to employ high angular resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (HARDI). HARDI is an advanced neuroimaging technique that provides detailed information about the structure and integrity of white matter tracts in the brain, particularly axons. By analyzing HARDI data from normal elderly individuals and patients with dementia, the lab can assess the degree of axonal degeneration and identify specific white matter pathways that are affected in these disorders. This information can be used to track disease progression, identify biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and evaluate the effectiveness of potential therapies.

The collaborative nature of the Allman lab, including partnerships with Professors Barbara Wold and Long Cai and their respective laboratories, is crucial for integrating diverse expertise and resources. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. By combining genomics, cell biology, and neuroimaging, the lab is making significant contributions to the field and paving the way for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The lab's research findings have the potential to improve the lives of millions of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. The focus on axonal integrity as a key factor in the pathogenesis of these disorders represents a significant avenue for future research and therapeutic development.

Introduction: The Emotion & Social Cognition Lab, also known as the Adolphs Lab, at Caltech, directed by Ralph Adolphs, Ph.D., is dedicated to elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying human social behavior. The lab's research program investigates a broad range of topics within social and affective neuroscience, employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates cognitive psychology, neuroimaging, and clinical neuropsychology. The central goal is to understand how the brain processes social information, how emotions influence cognition and behavior, and how these processes are disrupted in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

A significant focus of the Adolphs Lab is on emotion recognition, particularly the ability to infer emotional states from facial expressions. Researchers in the lab investigate the neural pathways involved in processing facial cues and linking them to emotional understanding. Eye-tracking technology is utilized to examine how individuals visually scan faces, revealing the specific facial features that are most informative for emotion perception and social judgment. This research extends to understanding how these processes are altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who often exhibit difficulties in social interaction and communication.

The lab also explores the neural basis of social judgments and decision-making. This includes examining how we form impressions of others, make moral judgments, and navigate social situations. Emotional influences on decision-making are a key area of investigation, with studies designed to reveal how emotions can bias our choices and affect our behavior in social contexts. Furthermore, the lab investigates the neural substrates of emotional memory, seeking to understand how emotionally charged events are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain, and how these processes contribute to our sense of self and social identity.

A hallmark of the Adolphs Lab's approach is its utilization of diverse clinical populations, including patients with rare brain lesions and individuals undergoing neurosurgical procedures. These patients provide unique opportunities to study the causal role of specific brain regions in social and emotional processing. By carefully mapping the cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with lesions in different brain areas, the lab can infer the functions normally supported by those regions. In addition to lesion studies, the lab leverages the advanced neuroimaging capabilities of the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, employing techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activity during social cognitive tasks. This allows researchers to identify the neural networks involved in processing social information and to investigate how these networks are modulated by factors such as emotion, context, and individual differences.

The Adolphs Lab actively recruits participants from both clinical populations and the general public to participate in its research studies. This commitment to community engagement ensures that the lab's findings are relevant to a broad range of individuals and contribute to a better understanding of human social behavior. The lab also fosters close collaborations with other laboratories at Caltech, both within the Division of Biology and the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences, promoting interdisciplinary research and the exchange of ideas. The work of the Emotion & Social Cognition Lab contributes significantly to the growing field of social neuroscience, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human social behavior and informing the development of interventions for individuals with social cognitive deficits. The research has broad implications for understanding and addressing challenges in mental health, education, and social policy.
