One major thrust of the Shapiro Lab’s research centers on the development and application of advanced ultrasound technologies. This includes the creation of "acoustic reporter genes" – genetically encoded molecules that generate ultrasound signals reflecting the activity or presence of specific cells or processes.  These reporter genes have evolved significantly, with the second generation (ARG 2.0) boasting enhanced sensitivity, nonlinear contrast, and ease of use across various cell types, enabling real-time in vivo monitoring of tumors and bacteria.  Furthermore, the lab has demonstrated the ability to use ultrasound to not only image but also directly control cellular behavior, a field termed "sonogenetics."

Introduction:

The provided website excerpt offers a glimpse into the research of Professor Chris Umans at Caltech's Computing and Mathematical Sciences department.  While the excerpt focuses on Professor Umans' individual research, it serves as a window into the broader theoretical computer science research conducted within Caltech's Theory Group, of which he is a member.  Therefore, this introduction will extrapolate from his expertise to describe the likely research areas and methodologies employed within the broader context of the group.

Professor Umans' research explicitly focuses on foundational problems in theoretical computer science, specifically within the realm of computational complexity.  This area investigates the inherent limitations and capabilities of computation, seeking to classify problems based on the resources required to solve them (e.g., time, memory, randomness).  A central theme is the exploration of efficient algorithms for solving complex problems.  His interest in derandomization highlights a key challenge: designing deterministic algorithms that match the efficiency of randomized algorithms, removing reliance on randomness.  This involves sophisticated techniques for constructing pseudorandom generators which can simulate randomness using deterministic processes.

Another crucial aspect of his work is explicit constructions. Many theoretical results demonstrate the existence of efficient objects (e.g., error-correcting codes, expander graphs) with desirable properties. However, the proofs often lack constructive methods for efficiently building these objects. Professor Umans' research likely contributes to the development of explicit constructions, providing efficient algorithms to build these useful computational tools. This area bridges theoretical guarantees with practical implementations.

His interest in algebraic complexity and algorithms reflects a deep dive into applying algebraic techniques to analyze the complexity of computational problems.  This may involve leveraging tools from linear algebra, abstract algebra, and number theory to design and analyze more efficient algorithms or prove lower bounds on the complexity of certain problems.  The exploration of hardness of approximation further underscores this focus on limits. It investigates the difficulty of finding approximate solutions to computationally hard optimization problems, even when exact solutions are computationally infeasible.

The methodology employed in this type of research is largely theoretical and mathematical. It relies heavily on rigorous proofs, formal models of computation, and advanced mathematical techniques.  Researchers formulate conjectures, develop new mathematical tools, and analyze existing algorithms.  The contributions of this research are multifaceted.  Firstly, it contributes to a deeper fundamental understanding of the nature of computation and its limitations. This has implications far beyond theoretical computer science; it informs the design of efficient algorithms used across numerous fields.  Secondly, the development of efficient algorithms and data structures directly impacts practical applications, improving the efficiency and performance of computational systems. Finally, proving hardness results provides valuable insights into which computational problems are inherently difficult to solve, guiding the development of approximation algorithms or heuristics for practical use.  The research, therefore, fundamentally shapes the boundaries of what is computationally possible and practical.  Professor Umans' affiliation with Caltech's Theory Group suggests a vibrant research environment fostering collaboration and contributing significantly to the advancement of theoretical computer science.

Understanding the inherent limitations of computation is crucial, particularly in the age of quantum computing. Research in this area likely focuses on understanding the relationships between different complexity classes and determining the limits of what can be computed efficiently with both classical and quantum algorithms.  This involves rigorous mathematical analysis and the development of novel proof techniques.

Finally, the mention of "Introduction to Cryptography" (CS152) suggests that the research group may also engage with aspects of classical cryptography, possibly in the context of post-quantum cryptography – developing cryptographic systems that remain secure even after the advent of powerful quantum computers.  This would be a vital area of research given the potential threat that quantum computers pose to current cryptographic standards.

In summary, Professor Vidick's research lab appears to be a highly specialized group conducting cutting-edge research at the intersection of theoretical computer science, quantum computing, and cryptography.

A cornerstone of the lab's research is the development and application of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM).  This technique represents a paradigm shift in high-throughput digital pathology.  Instead of relying solely on the physical limitations of optical systems, FPM cleverly transforms a complex optical problem into a computational one.  By computationally synthesizing a high-resolution image from a series of low-resolution images acquired under varied illumination conditions, FPM overcomes the inherent diffraction limits of traditional microscopy. This computational approach allows for significant improvements in spatial resolution and field-of-view, enabling a new level of detail in biological sample analysis.

This scalability is crucial for high-throughput applications in fields like disease diagnosis and drug screening.

Another significant area of research focuses on time-reversal optical focusing. This technique directly tackles the major hurdle of light scattering in biological tissues, which limits the depth penetration and resolution of traditional optical imaging methods. Biological tissues are highly turbid, scattering light in unpredictable ways, leading to blurry and low-resolution images.  The Biophotonics Lab's innovative use of time-reversal techniques essentially "reverses" the scattering process, enabling the focusing of light onto a target deep within the tissue.  This has immense potential implications for a range of applications including incisionless laser surgery, allowing for precise and targeted treatment with minimal invasiveness.  Moreover, it unlocks the possibility of high-resolution, deep-penetrating biochemical tissue imaging, opening up new avenues for studying tissue structure and function in unprecedented detail. The applications extend to optogenetics, where the precise focusing of light enables controlled stimulation of specific neurons or cells within the tissue volume.

The combination of these powerful methodologies—FPM and time-reversal optics—places the Biophotonics Laboratory at the forefront of biophotonics research.  Their contributions extend beyond the development of new techniques; they also focus on translating these advancements into practical applications.  The lab's commitment to both fundamental research and translational impact ensures that their innovations are not only scientifically rigorous but also hold the potential for significant clinical and therapeutic applications. The development of compact and affordable parallel microscopy systems using FPM, for instance, directly addresses accessibility issues in global healthcare. Similarly, the progress in time-reversal optical focusing could revolutionize minimally invasive surgical procedures and drastically improve the accuracy of diagnostic imaging.
