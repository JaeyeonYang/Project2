    "introduction": "The Zinn lab, located within the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, focuses on elucidating the roles of cell surface proteins in neural development and function, with a particular emphasis on synaptic connectivity. The lab's research leverages both *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruit fly) and human model systems to identify and characterize protein interactions that govern these processes. Their work has significantly contributed to our understanding of how specific protein interactions direct neuronal wiring, cell survival, and ultimately, behavior.\n\nA central theme of the Zinn lab's research is the mapping of protein-protein interactions using high-throughput screening methods. Initially, their work focused on the *Drosophila* nervous system, culminating in a global extracellular interactome screen published in 2013, in collaboration with the Garcia group at Stanford. This screen identified over 80 novel interactions among 200 fly cell surface proteins, laying the foundation for subsequent investigations into the functional roles of these interactions. Recognizing the importance of translating these findings to human biology, the Zinn lab expanded their interactome screening efforts to human cell surface proteins, again in collaboration with the Garcia group. A key accomplishment was a screen of over 500 human immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) cell surface proteins, published in 2020.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of traditional ELISA-based interactome screens, the lab developed innovative methodologies. Recognizing that a comprehensive screen of all ~2000 human single-transmembrane cell surface proteins would require the assessment of approximately 5 million pairwise interactions, they developed BPIA, a bead-based technology that allows for the simultaneous analysis of a single \"prey\" protein binding to hundreds of \"bait\" proteins attached to different fluorescently coded beads. Further innovations involved assembling prey proteins into 60-mer nanoparticles and utilizing the same extracellular domain (ECD) fusion proteins as both baits and preys, enhancing the speed, sensitivity, and versatility of the assay. These technological advancements formed the basis of a Transformative Research Grant (TRO1) from the NIH, awarded in 2022. This grant fuels the ongoing global human interactome screen, a collaborative effort involving the Zinn lab, the Protein Expression Center (headed by Jost Vielmetter), and the Thomson group at Caltech, and is directed by Woj Wojtowicz.\n\nBeyond identifying protein interactions, the Zinn lab is dedicated to understanding their functional consequences. A significant focus is on the Dpr-ome and Beat-Side interaction networks in *Drosophila*. These networks consist of interacting IgSF proteins, such as Dprs, DIPs, Beats, and Sides, which are expressed in subsets of neurons during development. The lab's research has demonstrated that DIP::Dpr interactions play critical roles in controlling synaptic connectivity and cell survival in the optic lobe and neuromuscular system. Their work has shown, for example, that interactions between Dpr11 and DIP-g control cell survival and synapse formation in specific optic lobe circuits. Studies on Dpr6, Dpr10, and DIP-a interactions have revealed the importance of binding affinity in regulating cell survival and neuronal targeting.\n\nFurthermore, the Zinn lab explores the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in RNA transport between cells in *Drosophila*. They have identified a cell surface protein, Stranded at Second, which mediates the targeted delivery of EVs containing a virus-like particle called dArc1. Their previous work on Drosophila receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) demonstrated their involvement in axon guidance and synapse formation.\n\nCollectively, the Zinn lab's research provides fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms governing neural development and synaptic connectivity. Their innovative methodologies, comprehensive interactome screens, and detailed functional studies have significantly advanced the field and offer promising avenues for understanding and potentially treating neurological disorders.\n\n\n=================================================="

    "introduction": "The Voorhees Lab focuses on understanding the intricate processes that govern protein production and quality control within the cell. Moving beyond the basic understanding of genetic information translation into amino acid sequences, the lab delves into the subsequent, and equally crucial, steps required for a protein to become functional. Their research acknowledges that the synthesis of a polypeptide chain is merely the beginning of a complex journey involving proper folding, accurate localization within the cell, and the formation of necessary complexes with other proteins. These steps are not isolated events but are meticulously monitored by cellular quality control pathways, which identify and eliminate defective mRNAs and proteins, ensuring proteome fidelity.\n\nThe lab's research is driven by two fundamental questions: first, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis and assembly; and second, deciphering how cells recognize and degrade aberrant mRNAs and proteins that fail during the maturation process. Understanding these pathways is critical, as defects in these downstream biosynthetic and surveillance mechanisms are implicated in a wide range of human diseases. By focusing on the intricate interplay between protein synthesis machinery and quality control factors, the Voorhees Lab aims to provide insights into the molecular basis of proteome maintenance and disease prevention.\n\nThe Voorhees Lab employs a multifaceted approach to address these complex biological questions.

A key technique they utilize is in vitro reconstitution, which allows for the precise control of experimental conditions and the study of individual components in isolation. This approach enables the researchers to dissect complex pathways and identify the specific roles of each factor involved.\n\nComplementing in vitro reconstitution are biochemical and cell-based assays, which provide valuable insights into the dynamics and regulation of these processes within a cellular context. These assays allow researchers to study the effects of mutations and other perturbations on protein synthesis, folding, and degradation, providing a more complete picture of the cellular response to stress and disease.\n\nA particularly powerful tool employed by the Voorhees Lab is cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This technique allows for the visualization of macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolution, providing critical structural information about the protein synthesis machinery, quality control factors, and their interactions. By combining structural data with functional assays, the Voorhees Lab is able to build detailed models of these complex processes, revealing the molecular mechanisms that underlie proteome fidelity.\n\nThe contributions of the Voorhees Lab are significant to the broader field of molecular biology and have implications for understanding and treating a variety of human diseases. By unraveling the molecular mechanisms of protein biosynthesis, assembly, and quality control, their research provides a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these essential cellular processes. Specifically, a deeper understanding of these processes may lead to the development of therapies that enhance protein folding, improve cellular localization, or promote the degradation of misfolded proteins, ultimately contributing to the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by proteome dysfunction.

    "introduction": "The Alexander J. Varshavsky research lab has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the ubiquitin system and its role in regulated protein degradation. Their research spans a broad range of topics, from the fundamental mechanisms of protein turnover to its implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and sleep regulation. The lab's work is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, combining biochemical, genetic, and cell biological techniques to unravel complex biological processes.\n\nA central focus of the Varshavsky lab is the ubiquitin system, particularly the N-degron pathway. The lab has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms of N-degron recognition, identifying the key enzymes involved (E3 ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitylating enzymes), and characterizing the physiological substrates of this pathway. Their discovery that the N-terminal residue of a protein can serve as a degradation signal (the N-end rule) revolutionized the understanding of protein half-life regulation. They demonstrated that specific N-terminal residues, termed \"destabilizing residues,\" target proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The lab has identified and characterized numerous components of the N-degron pathway, including the UBR family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, arginyltransferases, and N-terminal amidases. Their work has revealed the diverse functions of the N-degron pathway in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromosome stability, cardiovascular development, and neurogenesis. Furthermore, the lab has pioneered methods for studying the N-degron pathway, such as the heat-inducible degron and split-ubiquitin assays, which have been widely adopted by the scientific community.\n\nIn addition to their work on the ubiquitin system, the Varshavsky lab is exploring the potential of targeting cancer cells based on DNA deletions. This innovative approach leverages the fact that cancer cells often accumulate homozygous DNA deletions that are absent in normal cells. The lab proposes that these deletions can serve as \"immutable signposts\" for selective cancer therapy, enabling the development of drugs that specifically target and eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal tissues.\n\nAnother area of research in the Varshavsky lab concerns the molecular basis of sleep. The lab has proposed the \"fragment generation (FG) hypothesis,\" which posits that sleep evolved, at least in part, to counteract the accumulation of protein fragments in the brain and other organs during wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, the production of protein fragments, even at low levels, can disrupt cellular function and impair cognition, leading to the need for sleep to clear these fragments and restore normal brain activity. The lab's current research focuses on testing this hypothesis and identifying the specific protein fragments that contribute to sleep regulation.\n\nThe Varshavsky lab has also made significant contributions to the development of new biochemical and genetic methods. These include techniques for mapping DNA replication intermediates, mapping nucleosomes, ubiquitin fusion techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and methods for detecting protein interactions and protein degradation. These methods have proven to be invaluable tools for studying a wide range of cellular processes. The Varshavsky lab's work has had a profound impact on the fields of protein degradation, ubiquitin biology, cancer therapy, and sleep research. Their discoveries have provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms of cellular regulation and have opened new avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.\n\n\n=================================================="

However, their research scope extends beyond *C. elegans* to include parasitic nematodes, most notably *Steinernema hermaphroditum*, as well as other model systems such as budding yeast, mice, jellyfish, fungi, and human cells, when necessary. This broad approach reflects the lab's commitment to understanding fundamental biological principles applicable across diverse species.\n\nA core strategy employed by the Sternberg Lab is to perturb the activity of specific genes and meticulously observe the resulting cellular or organismal misbehavior. This allows them to infer gene function and delineate genetic pathways. Gene expression is quantified through RNA-seq and transgenic reporters, while behavioral analyses are conducted using automated systems and optogenetics. A central theme of their research centers on intercellular signals and their subsequent transduction within responding cells, ultimately leading to transcriptional outputs. By dissecting these signaling cascades, the lab aims to uncover the intricate regulatory networks that govern development and behavior.\n\nA significant aspect of the Sternberg Lab's work lies in identifying nematode genes that are counterparts to human genes. Recognizing the challenges in studying human gene function directly, the lab effectively utilizes the molecular genetics of *C. elegans* to investigate human genes with limited actionable information, particularly those implicated in human diseases. They study the consequences of genetic variants found in human individuals, including those associated with autism spectrum disorder, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex conditions.\n\nGiven the significance of nematodes as health and agricultural pests, the lab also prioritizes research into parasite-relevant biology. This includes investigating dauer/infective juvenile development, a crucial survival strategy for parasitic nematodes, using genomic and molecular genetic approaches. The lab’s recent publications highlight their diverse areas of expertise. They've made advancements in understanding enrichment analysis techniques, showing how focusing on steps in pathways, rather than genes alone, enhances the inference of differentially expressed pathways. Significant progress has also been made in cloning genes in *Steinernema hermaphroditum*, leading to the molecular identification of a peroxidase gene that controls body size in this insect-killing nematode, and in developing cGAL drivers for use in *C. elegans* sensory neurons.\n\nTheir work also extends to understanding how *C. elegans* processes chemosensory cues at different life stages, particularly in the context of CO2 and dauer formation. They've investigated the mechanical properties influencing mating behavior in *C. elegans* and characterized the transcriptomic profiles of sex-specific olfactory neurons. Furthermore, the lab is actively involved in developing and applying cutting-edge technologies, including hyperspectral imaging and solid medium-based culturing methods for *Steinernema hermaphroditum*.
